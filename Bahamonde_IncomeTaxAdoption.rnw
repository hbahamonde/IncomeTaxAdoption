\begin{abstract}
There is a very strong consensus on the role of fiscal capacities on state formation. Unfortunately, current theories focused on Latin America do not explain satisfactorily the origins of fiscal capacities. Taking a sectoral politics approach, this paper argues that the political monopoly pursued by agricultural economic elites was broken contingent on the emergence of a strong industrial sector. This major structural transformation triggered a series of institutional investments, as long as economic, political and social changes, planting the seed of states with high capacities. When agricultural monopolists were not challenged, these institutional investments never existed or were weak. We test this theory using cross-national panel data from 1900 to 2010 for a sample of Latin American countries. The Chilean example is offered as a shadow case to illustrate the mechanisms at work. Both approaches strongly confirm the theory.

% Hook
According  to many political economists, fiscal sociologists, development economist and economic historians, fiscal capacities are a prerequisite of ``strong'' states. Much effort has been devoted to understand the politics of taxation and state capacities for the European cases. However there is still much work to do to understand the development of post-colonial Latin America fiscal capacities. For example, though the consensus on the importance of fiscal capacities exists, the political and economic \emph{origins} of the fiscal capacities in Latin America  are still unclear. \emph{Why do some countries have ``better'' fiscal capacities than others? What have been the factors that led post-colonial Latin American countries to self-impose a system to directly tax individuals?} These questions are key to understand the development of the modern state in Latin America. Particularly, it is difficult to extend models originally developed to understand the medieval European case as wars in Latin America have been insufficient to mobilize domestic resources. Moreover, elite structures were very different, challenging the standard assumptions and incentives of these models. In this paper we shall inquire what were the \emph{conditions} that promoted the implementation of fiscal capacities and trace down its origins, specifically, in the Latin American context.

% Summary of the paper
Taxation is one of the most important capacities states have. In this paper we explain what were its origins. We argue that the modernization of the fiscal apparatus was product of a bargaining process between agricultural political incumbents and an emerging and politically excluded industrial sector. When the rate of industrial output was fast enough to compensate for long-term  losses relative to delayed access to liquidity, agricultural monopolistic incumbents imposed a system to tax income. In exchange, the industrial class demanded commercial protectionism in the form of tariffs and political representation via an institutionalized oligarchic competition system. Both the taxation and political representation dimensions triggered a series of institutional investments such as institutions of checks-and-balances to monitor and enforce that taxation, including the development of professional bureaucracies. The income tax law was then the tipping point that transformed ``weak'' states into ``strong'' states. When industrial output was slow, agricultural monopolistic incumbents faced higher opportunity costs and rather than ``wait and tax'' industrial output ``tomorrow'', they shifted to expropriation-type strategies ``today''. In these cases, the agricultural political monopoly was not broken, and the endogenous incentives to invest in institutions to share political power and improve bureaucratic bodies never existed. These countries were then trapped in an underdevelopment sub-optimal equilibria. We test these relationships using econometric methods for panel data, particularly hazard models, and qualitative/historical evidence. Both methodologies strongly support the argument.

% How Taxation Relates to State Building: Fiscal Sociology
\section{Taxation and State Formation}

% question no new // Tilly vs Centeno
The literature on state\footnote{Following \citet[p. 6]{Rueschemeyer:1992}, we define ``state'' as ``the set of organizations involved in making and implementing binding collective decisions, if necessary by force''.} capacities situates taxation as one of the two main state capacities\footnote{The other one being \emph{legal capacities} and the study of the role of contract enforcement and  property rights protection. See \citet{Cardenas2010}. Another example is \citet{Strayer:2005uq}, who argues for the European case that ultimately, was the monopoly of \emph{justice} what conformed the modern state (rather than the monopoly of \emph{violence}). See \citet{Besley2010} for an approach centered on property rights protection.}. States are \emph{capable} (or not) of raising (or not) revenues, including income taxes. There still is great debate on what is the causal relationship between taxation and the formation of the modern state. Starting with \citet{Tilly:1992rr}\footnote{See also \citet[p. 162, 170]{Ames1977} where they argue that in Europe, ``[m]edieval taxation developed from the ``extraordinary'' revenues, and ultimately became the fiscal basis of government [...] When governments found efficient sources of tax revenues in wartime it would have served their best interests to make these incomes permanent and unconditional''.}, the idea that international conflicts forced motivated kings to levy taxes, has gained much scholarly support\footnote{. See for example \citet{Ertman}.}. As the argument goes, local elites bargained representation to monitor the king's behavior\footnote{\citet{Stasavage:2011aa}. See also \citet{Levi:1989lq}.}. However, these mechanisms have been recently challenged\footnote{\citet{Boucoyannis2015}.}. Particularly, outside Europe, the relationship between war and state formation is still contested\footnote{\citet[p. 1218]{Besley2009} do find that ``The United States first introduced a form of income taxation in 1861 during the Civil War, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was founded on the back of this with the Revenue Act of 1862''.}. For example, \citet{Centeno:2002qf} finds that there were not enough wars to mobilize domestic sources of revenue, and that the few wars that existed were financed by acquiring debt. \citet[p. 665]{Arias2012} finds that in M\'exico, ``a focal central authority'' was required \emph{prior} to be able to centralize fiscal institutions in the presence of external threats. However, it is not clear where that \emph{prior} centralization comes from. Given all these theoretical and empirical difficulties, some have gone up in the ``ladder of abstraction'', and replaced ``war'' for ``interstate rivalries''\footnote{\citet[]{Thies2005a}.}, while others have interacted the presence of military conflict with state-military alliances\footnote{\citet[p.  37]{Lopez-Alves:2000zl}.}. Clearly, the politics of taxation (though acknowledged) remains disputed. Moreover, the \emph{origins} of fiscal capacities remains rather unclear\footnote{A rather counterintuitive argument is presented by \citet[p. 314]{Lange2008}. They introduce the ``instigating'' model, where they find that states with high levels of state infrastructural power contain more violence.}.

% This paper changes the focus from only "external incentives" to domestic ones
This paper acknowledges the possible influence of external threats. However it presents an argument based on the \emph{endogenous domestic} factors that lead (or not) early (late) Latin American countries to invest in fiscal institutions. Most of the literature on state formation puts its emphasis on the financial \emph{needs} caused by wars. While our focus also shares the same emphasis centered on \emph{fiscal needs}, it changes the focus from \emph{external incentives}, to the \emph{domestic incentives} political and economic elites had to to legally \emph{robber} (i.e. ``tax'') domestic profit via an income tax.


% Introducing Fiscal Sociology. 
We build on the ``fiscal sociology'' paradigm which argues that the political economy of public finances offers ``the key'' for a theory of the state\footnote{	\citet[p. 99]{Musgrave1992}.}. According to \citet[p. 108]{Schumpeter:1991yq}, ``[t]axes not only helped to create the state. They helped to form it''. From a historical perspective, this paradigm proposes that the great modern cleavage was not the rise of capitalism (Marx) nor the rise of modern bureaucracy (Weber), but the rise of the ``tax state'', which developed institutions to penetrate the private, i.e. \emph{individual}, economies\footnote{\citet[p. 298]{Moore2004a}. This view is also shared by \citet[p. 100]{Schumpeter:1991yq} and \citet[p. 42]{Lewis:1965fr} - See epigraphs.}. From a conceptual perspective, the mere concept of ``tax state'' might be even be misleading: ``tax'' has so much to do with ``state'' that the expression ``tax state'' might almost be considered a \emph{pleonasm}\footnote{\citet[p. 101]{Schumpeter:1991yq}.}.

% Not all kind of taxes play a formative role: DIRECT vs INDIRECT
% Income tax is the most difficult tax // separate
\emph{Not} all kind of taxes play a \emph{formative} role. \emph{Direct} taxation is more likely to create appropriated conditions for the development of strong fiscal capacities. Direct taxation involves a \emph{compulsory transfer} from private hands into the government sector for public purposes\footnote{\emph{Cfr.} Raja Chellia, ``Trends in Taxation in Developing Countries'', in \citet[p. 282]{Migdal:1988nr}.}. Hence, these taxes are harder to collect (compared to \emph{indirect} taxes), and so they require the development of skilled bureaucrats. Furthermore, the most invasive way of direct taxation, and hence the most difficult one to levy, is \emph{income taxation}. This type of tax is quite complex as it ``separates'' private from public property\footnote{\citet[p. 98]{Musgrave1992}.} at the individual level, within the entire territory. From a historical standpoint, 
its introduction ``was one of the major events in fiscal history that contributed to the growth in government observed during the past 150 years''\footnote{\citet[p. 171]{Aidt2009a}.}. From a state-formation standpoint, direct taxation requires the development of the know-how to be able to collect, administer and enforce these taxes. Hence, weak states, usually trapped in a vicious circle, engaged in low-cost inefficient taxation methods. As others have argued, ``administrative constraints are identified as the main constraint to the ability of states to collect revenues in general and direct taxes such as income tax in particular''\footnote{\citet[p. 5]{DiJohn2006}.}. For example, ``[i]n 1967 the national income tax office in Guatemala employed 194 people, only 9 of whom had graduated from  a college''\footnote{\citet[p. 5]{DiJohn2006}.}. 

% INDIRECT TAXES
\emph{Indirect} taxes generally do not lead to the development of strong fiscal capacities. According to,  \citet[p. 53]{Best1976} ``indirect taxes are but substitutes for direct taxes'', and hence they are typically administered by weak states\footnote{This view is also supported by \citet[p. 14]{Moore2004}.}. Since indirect taxes typically do not have major influence on state capacities,  this revenue is generally considered ``unearned income''\footnote{\citet[p. 304]{Moore2004a}.} or ``easy-to-collect source of revenues''\footnote{\citet[p. 10]{Coatsworth2002}.}. In particular, given the low costs weak states have to incur to receive this tax money, indirect taxation has (nearly) null impact on bureaucratization. \citet[p. 177]{Campbell1993} argues that ``[i]n Latin America, for instance, when the state depends heavily on the taxation of international trade [...] the state apparatus tends to be less developed because the collection of tariffs and duties does not require an elaborate fiscal structure''. Since weak states are not able to develop the capacities to collect direct taxes, they mostly rely on taxes applied to imported goods. \citet[p. 132]{Bertola2012} for example, explain that in weak states, since ``[c]ustoms administrations were concentrated in a few critical locations, especially ports, [c]ustoms duties seemed to be an attractive means of boosting revenues''. Taxes on natural resources are another example of ``unearned income''.



% Geographical constrains
%\footnote{Geographical constrains are another limitation. For example, \citet[p. 132]{Bertola2012} argue that ``[a]lthough various attempts were made to set up a direct taxation system, which was a particularly attractive option for some liberal thinkers during this period, the implementation of such a system would have been a very costly undertaking for the new republics, especially in the case of agricultural activities, which were so widely \emph{spread out}''. Emphasis is mine.}. 

% DON'T INCLUDE: REPETITIVE
%``The detrimental factors commonly identified in developing country tax systems are: insufficient staff with appropriate skills, low public-sector wages, lack of up-to-date equipment and facilities [and] poor information collection and identification of taxpayers''\footnote{\citet[p. 5]{DiJohn2006}.}. 

% Political impediments
Weak states not only have to overcome the lack of administrative skills to collect direct taxes. They also have to secure domestic political compromises. Political  constrains are big impediments to collect direct taxes, and one of the most important ones, are class interests. Some have argued that ``tax struggles are among the oldest forms of class struggle''\footnote{Goldscheid (1925), in \citet[p. 168]{Campbell1993}.}. Taking a macro-historical and class-centered standpoints\footnote{See also \citet[]{Rueschemeyer:1992}.}, we build on the idea that ``tax revenues depend upon the interests of different classes as they attempt to use political power via the state for their own needs and purposes''\footnote{\citet[p. 50]{Best1976}. Furthermore, he argues that the ``actual composition of taxes can be viewed as dependent upon the distribution of power rather than as an expression of the free choice of the majority of the people'' (in \citet[p. 71]{Best1976}). For a similar analysis, see also \citet[p. 169]{Campbell1993}.}. As the paper explains later, the joint occurrence of taxation and bureaucratization (contingent on the existence of a strong industrial sector) led post-independent Latin American nations to secure a political compromise. This compromise was the critical juncture that helped to create the endogenous incentives to overcome the initial lack of administrative skills to collect direct taxes. The joint occurrence of taxation and bureaucratization also helped to create the conditions for the emergence of the semi-democratic/oligarchic republics that guaranteed political competition for the elites in the early 20th century. This framework of (limited) political competition gave birth to a series of institutional investments, which we detail later in the paper.


% Issues: 
  % (1) institutional development/state development
  % (2) Bureaucratization per se/state development
  % (3) different measurements of taxation
  % (4) LA did not have an industrial revolution

% (1)
Some precisions are needed. First, a simple association between bureaucratization, or more general, institutional development, and political aperture would be incorrect. As \citet[p. 26]{Mahoney:2010aa} suggests, there is a negative association between ``mercantilist institutions'' (which required very \emph{complex} bureaucracies) and political development. For example, Per\'u had very strong ``mercantilist institutions'', and as a consequence, lower levels of political development. Similarly, \citet{Acemoglu:2002uh} explain how colonial mercantilist countries show little economic growth\footnote{We propose a roughly simultaneous process. However, \citet[p. 43]{Rota2011a} suggests a different timing. He explains that ``[t]he modernization of bureaucracy \emph{preceded} the process of democratization''. Emphasis is mine.}. This paper explains the origins of income taxation and how it played an important role in the formation of national states \emph{after} the independence, particularly, during the implementation of the liberal political projects. 

% (2)
Second, bureaucratization \emph{per se} does not cause state capacities either. On the one hand, \citet[]{Soifer} explains that ``local'' bureaucrats (as opposed to central/state bureaucrats) carried their own agendas, undermining the state consolidation process at the local level. Acknowledging this, this paper rather focuses on the formative role structural transformations had on \emph{modern} bureaucracies, (i.e. post-``industrial'') bureaucracies, and such it broadly builds on \citet[]{ODonnell1973}, \citet[]{Lipset:1981uq} and  \citet[]{Przeworski1993,Przeworski1997}. Particularly, we explain how industrialization helped to create institutional order, and ultimately, ``state capacities'' in post colonial Latin America. On the other hand, \citet[p. 45]{Evans:1995xy} argues that conventional dichotomies like ``strong'' versus ``weak'' mislabel any theory of the state. For example, predatory states (i.e., non-democracies) usually have very skilled bureaucracies. However, in our theory, bureaucracies (at least for the ``strong'' capacity cases) are product of a process of inter-elite \emph{contestation}. The lack of monopolistic rule (i.e., the presence of inter-elite political contestation) is what brings skilled and semi-independent bureaucracies to life. This distinction is important since most predatory states are usually ruled by a monopolistic ruler (party, leader, sector, etc.). 

% (3)
Third, there are ongoing measurement and conceptual debates in the literature. Though many scholars find that income taxation, alone, explains considerable variance of state capacities\footnote{See for example, \citet[p. 15]{Hanson2013b} and \citet[]{Centeno:2002qf}.}, others have argued in favor of others measurements of ``stateness''. For example, some scholars have argued in favor of military conscription or censuses\footnote{For the latter, see for example, \citet{Lee2013a}.}. Multidimensional measurements are also very popular. Contrasting several existent indexes of state capacities, \citet[p. 7]{Fukuyama:2004nr} argues that ``stateness'' is a two-dimensional concept, namely, the \emph{scope of state activities}, which refers to different state functions and the \emph{strength of state power}, or the ability of states to execute policies. In a later work, however, \citet[p. 347]{Fukuyama2013}  suggests a  different two-dimensional framework, \emph{capacity} and \emph{autonomy}. Similarly, \citet[p. 357]{Mann2008a} argues that ``stateness'' is a two-dimensional concept too, one being the \emph{despotic} and an the other one being the \emph{infrastructural} power concept\footnote{\citet[p. 224]{Soifer2008} argue in favor of the infrastructural approach proposed by \citet[]{Mann1984a}.}. \citet{Soifer2012} proposes a three-dimensional measurement of state capacity, namely \emph{security}, \emph{administrative} and \emph{extractive}. Multidimensional conceptualizations of state capacities do improve our understanding of the complexity of state capacities\footnote{As \citet[p. 9]{Fukuyama:2004nr} explains, ``[a] country like Egypt, for example, has very effective internal security apparatus and yet cannot execute simple tasks like processing visa applications or licensing small businesses efficiently''. In Singerman, (1995).}. Beyond being a measurement commentary, this paper develops a theory for the origins of, what we believe, is one of the \emph{main} state capacities. Moreover, from an empirical and conceptual standpoints, parsimonious explanations about a complex phenomena\footnote{\citet[p. 112]{Mann1984a} argues that ``[t]he state is undeniably a messy concept''.} enjoy from different advantages. 

% (4)
Finally, it is important to say that our theoretical model does not require European-like degrees of industrialization. As \citet[p. 131]{Bertola2012} confirm it, most Latin American countries did \emph{not} experience a proper industrialization \emph{process}, and hence it is inaccurate to say that the industrial sector ``had become a strong engine of economic growth''. However, even when Latin America did not experience an industrial \emph{revolution}, the modern sector did experience clusters of development (see \autoref{fig:incometax}). 

% The purpose of this paper
The purpose of this paper is to explain the origins of \emph{strong} and \emph{weak} \emph{state} capacities. We do so by tracing their origins of \emph{strong} and \emph{weak} \emph{fiscal} capacities. It is important to stress that this paper does not equate  \emph{higher taxation levels} with \emph{higher levels of ``stateness''}. For example, since ``American institutions [were] deliberately designed to weaken or limit the exercise of state power''\footnote{\citet[p. 6]{Fukuyama:2004nr}.}, the U.S. taxes very little. However, it is not reasonable to say that the U.S. has a ``weak state''. Rather, this paper proposes that the \emph{development} of a direct tax system, particularly, \emph{income taxation}, is causally related to the origins of state capacities and other institutional developments\footnote{See for example \citet[p. 117]{Besley2014}, where they argue that ``[t]axation has played a central role in the development of states''.}. Fiscal economists dot not necessarily look at the actual tax-to-GDP ratio either, but rather at ``tax efforts''. This index measures the ratio between the proportion of actual collection and taxable capacity\footnote{For example, \citet[p. 54]{Best1976} calculates tax efforts for Central America.}. Moreover,  as explained in the \hyperref[argument]{argument} section and illustrated in our \hyperref[unpacking]{case study}, the income tax system was fundamental for the formation of the LA states, not the for the actual tax money levied  but for the set of institutions and political compromises that were needed to implement such a system.
 
% Why care paragraph
The problem at hand is of the greatest importance. The idea that higher fiscal capacities are related to more capable states is widely accepted by many political economists\footnote{For an example, see \citet[]{Besley:2011aa}.}. However, it is unclear what the \emph{origins} of income taxation are. Much effort has been devoted to the study of tax reforms. For example, \citet[]{Fairfield2013} studies different strategies policymakers pursue to tax elites starting in 1990. \citet[]{Mahon2004} and \citet{Focanti:2015rt} study causes of tax reform in Latin America starting around 1980s and 1990, respectively. Similarly, \citet[]{Ross2004} studies the relationship between taxation and representation between 1971 and 1997. Whereas \citet{Sokoloff2007a} study the evolution of tax institutions comparing the U.S. with Latin America. We share \citet[p. 5]{DiJohn2006}'s diagnosis in that ``[t]here is no attempt to explain \emph{why} and \emph{how} administrative capacities change. Second, there is no explanation as to why tax capacities differ across countries''\footnote{Emphases are mine}. Acknowledging these contributions, we expand on these prior findings by presenting a comparative macro-structural argument which traces under which conditions endogenous investments in fiscal capacities were more likely to happen in Latin America starting in 1900. 

% The reminder of this paper proceeds as follows // This paper builds on
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. First, we present and develop our \hyperref[argument]{argument}. Taking a sectoral politics approach, the paper argues that the political monopoly pursued by agricultural economic elites was broken when an emerging industrial sector accepted to be income-taxed in exchange for industrial tariffs (i.e. protectionism) and political representation, leading to the 19th century political oligarchies. These political and economic concessions between the two sectors were accelerated by unfavorable international conditions. A decline on imported goods decreased import taxes, putting internal pressures to generate internal revenue. Second, in the \hyperref[unpacking]{historical} section, we present Chile as a shadow case to illustrate in more detail the mechanisms at work. Third, in the \hyperref[methods]{econometric} section, we test the theory using cross-national panel data on sectoral outputs from 1900 to 2010 for a sample of Latin American countries. Finally, we conclude with a brief \hyperref[discussion]{discussion}.


\section{Argument\label{argument}}

% Overview
Our argument comes in four parts for both the ``weak'' and ``strong'' state cases. We first layout our theory in abstract. Then we develop each part of the argument in more detail. Next \hyperref[unpacking]{section} illustrate the causal mechanisms at work.

% (1) Latin American states were governed by agricultural monopolistic elites
% (2) industrial output rates
% (3) agricultural incumbents taxed or expropriated  industrial output // logic behind each strategy
% (4) protectionism, representation and institutional investments

% strong state case
\paragraph{Strong State Cases} First, following the inertia of post-colonial legacies, early Latin American states were governed by agricultural monopolistic elites. The incipient industrial sector, conformed by newcomers around 1900s, was politically excluded. Second, industrial output rates were faster than agricultural rates. Third, agricultural incumbents could either \emph{tax} or \emph{expropriate}  industrial output. Since the benefit of taxing a small sum of money ``today'' via taxation compensated the long-term losses associated of having those resources ``tomorrow'', agricultural elites decided to tax the industrial sector. Fourth, in exchange, the industrial class demanded commercial protectionism (tariffs) and political representation, originating a system of oligarchic political competition. Both taxation and political representation triggered a series of institutional investments such as institutions of checks-and-balances. These institutions were able to monitor and enforce income taxation, including the development of professional bureaucracies.

% weak state case
\paragraph{Weak State Cases} Similarly, these states were governed by agricultural monopolistic elites too. However, in the weak state cases,  agricultural incumbents faced a slower industrial sector. Consequently, industrial outputs did not promise enough resources to tax from in the long run. It was too risky to ``wait'' and tax those resources in the future. Hence, incumbents were better off expropriating the small industrial output in the short run. The agricultural political monopoly was not challenged, the traditional economy was not broken and the endogenous incentives to invest in institutions designed to improve bureaucracies and split political power never existed.

% (1) Latin American states were governed by agricultural monopolistic elites
\subsection{Agricultural Monopoly}

% monopoly: explaining in which sense this was a "monopoly".
By definition, monopolies limit the entrance of alternative goods. In general, monopolies generate waste and negative externalities. In this case, and as the \hyperref[unpacking]{historical} section illustrates, we argue that \emph{political} monopolies, that is, a situation where political competition is either naturally or artificially limited, generate political and economic distortions. In the weak-state cases, the agricultural sector could easily impose policies convenient for them, at the expenses of the non-represented segments of the society. States that eventually transited to the strong condition, \emph{also} started under a monopolistic rule. However, for several reasons we explain in this paper, an industrial sector managed to challenge the incumbents, triggering a series of institutional investments and other structural transformations.


% (2) industrial output rates
\subsection{Industrial Output Speed Rates and Economic Contestation}

% explain the logic of industrial/agricultural output rates
%Despite the initial monopolistic conditions of the agricultural sector in virtually the whole continent, what eventually would be strong state cases, saw an incipient industrial sector grow. 
There were many factors that explain the first industrial boom in LA. Among these, tariffs oriented to protect the agricultural markets unintentionally helped to protect the domestic industrial sector. Since the first industries processed raw agricultural materials, better conditions for the land helped (along with favorable international markets) industrialists make their way. \autoref{fig:incometax} shows output differentials (in logarithmic scales) from 1900 to 2010 for a sample of Latin American countries\footnote{We use the \emph{Montevideo-Oxford Latin American Economic History Data Base}  (\href{http://moxlad-staging.herokuapp.com/home/en?}{MOxLAD}), specifically the \emph{agriculture value-added} and \emph{manufacturing value-added} variables. The former measures ``the output of the sector net of intermediate inputs and includes the cultivation of crops, livestock production, hunting, forestry and fishing''. The later  ``[r]eports the output of the sector net of intermediate inputs''. Both of them are expressed in local currency at 1970 constant prices. Finally, ``the depreciation of reproducible assets or depletion/degradation of natural resources were not deducted''. Details about this dataset are presented in the \hyperref[data]{data} section.}. Additionally, each plot shows two vertical lines. The green line shows when the system was opened for contestation\footnote{We proxy this using Boix's data on democratization. See \citet[]{Boix2012}.}, while the sky blue line shows when the income tax law was passed\footnote{Author's data. Based on several reports and official information. We discuss and justify our sample in the \hyperref[data]{data} section.}. Contrary to \citet[p. 241]{Bulmer-Thomas2003}, we do \emph{not} find that ``[e]verywhere [...]  industrial growth exceeded agricultural growth''. Chile had a very contested political economy: both sectors had approximately the same size. In fact, the industrial sector not only caught up agricultural output but also surpassed it around 1930, which is around the time when income taxation was imposed. The total opposite happened in Nicaragua. This country never had a strong industrial sector.

% Inter-Elite inequality // %  political competition and state capacities
Sectoral output differentials measure the levels of inter-elite conflict. In other words, \autoref{fig:incometax} operationalizes the degree in which the agricultural sector was ``challenged'' (or not) by an incipient industrial sector. %As we explain below, political monopolies were terminated when the levels of inter-sectoral equality were high. Given the structural transformations these cases went through, they were able to develop ``strong'' state institutions and competitive oligarchic political systems. However, when inter-sectoral equality was low, that is when the agricultural sector kept dominating since colonial period through the 19th and 20th centuries, political resources were oriented to prioritize policy goods for the agricultural sector.
We build on theories that claim that economic and political competition (or the lack of) have a positive (or negative) impact on state capacities. For example, \citet[p. 481]{Kurtz2009} argues that where ``no faction can easily become permanently dominant'', state capacities should be higher. Similarly, \citet{Geddes1991} argues that competition between two rival parties of about the same size create the incentives to invest in political institutions. \citet[p. 40]{Cardenas2010} in his formal and empirical models also finds that ``concentration of political and economic power reduces the incentives to invest in state capacity''. However, he models inequality between \emph{elites} and \emph{citizens}. We expand on this idea by modeling the period \emph{before} full democratization existed and also by modeling the interest of two types of elites. This paper also builds on theories on the sectoral origins of income taxation. As development economists argue, there is an intrinsic sectoral conflict between the two sectors regarding generation of income and its potential taxation. For example, \citet[p. 55]{Best1976}, argues that ``the sectoral origin of income is an important determinant of tax potential [...] the agricultural sectors in Central America preclude[d] effective income taxation''. Similarly, \citet[]{Mares2015} study how income taxation in Europe is associated to between-elites conflicts, particularly between the landed elite and the industrial elite\footnote{However, state-capacities are tangentially studied.}. Taxation and state formation has been studied in Africa too. For example, \citet{SanchezdelaSierra2014} studies the relationship between taxation and state formation in Eastern Congo. This paper elaborates on these insights by tracing the \emph{political origins} of income taxation. As argued later in the paper, economic equality paired with political inequality introduced endogenous incentives to build both \emph{state} and \emph{democratic} institutions. 

Intra-elite (in)equality and regime type plays a fundamental role in our argument. There have been important recent contributions lately (see for example \citet[Ch. 9]{Acemoglu:1996rm} and  \citet[]{Ansell:2014ty}). Building on this literature, we introduce the state capacities question. Our findings are consistent with \citet[p. 9]{Rueschemeyer:1992}, in that ``[c]onsolidation of state power was an essential prerequisite for democratization''. One of our main contributions is the idea that inter-elite political inequality paired with inter-elite economic equality plays a fundamental role in political/institutional development. \citet[]{Garfias2015} finds in M\'exico the exact opposite: \emph{unequal} relative distribution of political and economical power causes state formation. The proposed mechanism is that ruling elites, taking advantage of their transitory strengthened  position, expropriate weaker elites and send bureaucrats to control local weakened bosses (his proxy for state capacities). We find that political monopolies were broken when the excluded industrial sector gained economic leverage.% that allowed them to bargain better political and economical conditions.

%\paragraph{Strong States: A story of economic contestation and political competition} The states that turned into ``strong'' and states that stayed ``weak'', shared the same initial monopolistic conditions. However, ``strong'' states were able (while being ``weak'' states) to break the structural advantages traditional sector.  What eventually differentiated strong from weak states was that the former had an industrial sector backed up with rapid industrial growth, which allowed them to bargain better political and economical conditions with the traditional sector.

% (3) agricultural incumbents taxed or expropriated industrial output // logic behind each strategy
\subsection{Taxation, Expropriation and the Industrial Sector}

% Explain both strategies
Higher levels of inter-elite economic equality, propitiated by healthy industrial outputs, were able to break the initial monopolistic conditions that were beneficial to the traditional sector. Building on the ``stationary bandit''\footnote{\citet[]{Olson:2000aa}.} concept, this paper develops two possible strategies for agricultural political incumbents. Each one is best response depending on the rate of industrial growth. The first strategy is to engage in \emph{predatory practices}, expropriating industrial output and enjoying short-term benefits associated to immediate liquidity. Just expelling industrial elites and taking over the industries is not efficient. Since human capital and technology are non-transferable between the two sectors\footnote{For example, machines used to make glass can't be used to grow potatoes.}, if this strategy is pursued, industrial output is exhausted in the long run. In consequence, agricultural elites are better off expropriating industrial elites rather than taking over their industries. Since they don't know how to manage them, they end up bankrupting industry. Due to the benefits associated to industrial expropriation ``today'' offset the benefits of rather encouraging industrial production and tax it ``tomorrow'', expropriation is best response when the rate of industrial growth is slow. In simply words, the long-term benefits of having a secured, \emph{but excessively small} source of tax revenue \emph{do not} offset the benefits associated to have immediate monetary resources product of the expropriation. The second strategy consists of \emph{institutional investments} that allowed agricultural incumbents to ``rob'' industrial output in small doses at a time through a direct taxation system. This idea is consistent with \citet[p. 126]{Acemoglu2000a} too, in that potentially political losers instead of blocking innovation\footnote{It is important to stress that we do \emph{not} refer to domestic technological innovation. Rather, technological innovation should be assumed to be exogenous. As \citet[p. 135]{Bertola2012} explain, ``[t]he main two vehicles for international technology transfer [...] were foreign investment and immigration [...] [m]any immigrants already had the experience of living in an industrial civilization; they brought with them knowledge, practical experience, an entrepreneurial and technical culture, a work ethic, knowledge of new forms of commercial organization''.}, imposed a tax. 

% FAST GROWTH //  WHY INCOME TAXES? WHY NOT EXPROPRIATE THEM?
In cases where industrial growth kept growing at faster rates, agricultural political incumbents incorporated a proportional fiscal mechanism to capture increasing tax rates. Particularly, the system had to be able to monitor closely industrial magnates and their personal incomes. In other words, an \emph{income tax} had to be implemented\footnote{We build on the idea that political elites generally are better able to impose/raise taxes during economic booms. For example, \citet[p. 647]{Campbell1994} argue that ``economic development should be directly related to individual and corporate income tax rates''. Also, \citet[p. 59]{Besley:2011aa} argue that ``investing in fiscal capacity becomes more attractive [...] when wages or incomes [...] are higher''.}. This strategy is best response when industrial growth rates are fast. Since the long-term benefits of having a secured large tax source for the future offset the short-term costs of enjoying that revenue in the future, agricultural elites were better off taxing industrial output rather than expropriating it. Again, expelling the industrial elites was not efficient due to the non-transferability of human capital and technology. Hence, agricultural incumbents were better off having a rather small tax revenue secured for the future than having a relatively larger sum of money ``today'', but exhausting it and having nothing ``in the future''. In fact, it was in the agricultural incumbents' interest to protect and encourage industrial growth as that would translate into higher revenues for the treasury. As other have explained before, by imposing an income tax system, the treasury appoints itself as the investor's partner who will always share in the investor's gains and losses\footnote{\citet[p. 389]{Domar1944}.}.

% SLOW GROWTH //  WHY EXPROPRIATE THEM
Cases that experienced low industrial output rates tended to engage in expropriation, nationalization and forced loaning. Our theory builds on the relationship between inter-elite (in)equality and political development. \citet[76]{Ansell:2014ty} argue that when inter-sectoral inequality is high, the landed elite expropriates indirectly through ``market-distorting policies'', harming rising elites such as the industrial elites. Building on this idea, we argue that agricultural rulers decide to expropriate because their discount factors exceed the benefits associated to taxed industrial output in the long-run. As explained before, technology and human capital are assumed to be non-transferable. Hence, given small industrial growth rates, agricultural elites are better off having access to immediate liquidity, even when those resources get exhausted in the long run. Historians confirm that expropriation was an inter-sectoral issue. \citet[p. 255, 342-343]{Bulmer-Thomas2003} explain that it was very common to nationalize non-agricultural assets such as transport companies, financial institutions, and mining industries, specially oil. 

% Barriers to technology adoption: Link with other literature THIS ON AN EXPROPRIATION SECTION
Inter-sectoral competition, and the decision of whether expropriate or tax the industrial sector, links with the ``barriers to technology adoption'' literature\footnote{See \citet{Parente1994a}.}. Industrial development was also a function of the incentives agricultural elites as political rulers had to block (or not) new technologies. However, we do not present an argument of \emph{economic losers}, in which (usually) monopolies block/expropriate substitute technologies. Contrary to \citet[p. 127]{Acemoglu2000a}, industrial development is not blocked by agricultural elites ``because there is no credible commitment to compensate them once economic changes have been implemented''. However, expropriation acts as a way for rulers to provide instantaneous liquidity. One could argue the reverse. Given that economic changes alter the distribution of political power, when the industrial sector increases, so do the incentives for agricultural incumbents to expropriate them (rather than tax them, as we argue). For example \citet[p. 28]{Robinson1999} argues that ``[i]f development changes the political equilibrium, then this may deter elites from creating institutions and adopting policies which stimulate development'', engaging in predatory policies. However, why not profit from the other's growth? If the future is bright (based on fast industrial growth rates), incumbent elites should rather impose a tax, as \citet[]{Olson:2000aa}'s ``stationary bandits'' do. We claim that when industrial growth is small, the \emph{political} threat of being displaced by a weak economic sector is non-credible. Under these conditions, political concessions are not required and institutional investments are less likely. As \citet[p. 73]{Boix:2015aa} clarifies, ``states only exist to counteract a potential situation of conflict between agents with different economic interests and military capacities''. If there is not a counteracting party, institutions helped to perpetuate the old agricultural order. Ultimately, barriers to technology adoption and industrial development were not implemented because of the fear of being \emph{politically} and/or \emph{economically} displaced, but because there was not added value for ruling elites letting industry grow. This assumption is corroborated in the data.  \autoref{fig:incometax} shows that, \emph{in general}, industrial outputs were rather slow, making either political or economic threats coming from the industrial sector non-credible. 



%here is about elites afraid of being \emph{political losers}. In line with \citet{Acemoglu2000a}, political monopolists could not afford to endanger their relative stronger political position by being displaced economically. 


%Similarly, we argue that when industrial output is not large-enough to compensate for long-term losses associated to future taxation of little revenues, incumbents engaged in predatory strategies. In other words, when discount factors exceeded the benefits associated to taxed industrial output in the long-run, ruling elites rather engaged in expropriation. 



% (4) protectionism, representation and institutional investments
\subsection{Income taxation and Institutional Investments}

% the new income tax was not important because of the extra revenue
When it comes to taxation, the public economics literature focuses mostly on tax revenues. However, the \emph{politics} of taxation is an equally important matter\footnote{\citet[]{Focanti:2015rt}.}. We claim that the new income tax was not important because of the extra revenue income taxation brought the treasury but because of the introduction of endogenous state institutions. Higher levels of inter-elite equality -i.e., higher levels of inter-elite contestation- led to the imposition of income taxation. This endogenous disturbance triggered a series of institutional investments. Most notably, the introduction of political representation for the industrial elites and industrial tariffs. It is important to stress that this is a situation of ``\emph{quasi-voluntary compliance}''\footnote{\citet{Levi:1989lq}.}. Even when the industrial sector in strong-state cases continue having increasing outputs (and hence, higher taxes to pay), they are still better off paying income taxes to continue receiving economic protection (tariffs) as we explain below.

% political representation
The progressive industrialization of the economy, while structural transformation, brought a very important change, namely the breaking of the political monopoly led by the agricultural elite. In turn, political competition brought several economic and political changes. Since open political systems are the most effective ones for processing and aggregating diverse interests\footnote{\citet[p. 3]{Roclrik2000}.}, industrialists were willing to be taxed in exchange of political representation. That way, both sectors could introduce institutions for macroeconomic stabilization and other regulatory institutions. Moreover, as simply promising keeping income tax rates constant was not credible, industrialists had all positive incentives to seek political representation. A new competitive oligarchy was born. This goes in line with several political economists who find that in \emph{less} developed countries, higher tax collection levels are associated to strong political party systems\footnote{\citet[p. 8]{DiJohn2006}.}. Political scientists also find that higher levels of political competition are associated with better institutional designs. We provide further details in our \hyperref[unpacking]{case study}. 

% industrial tariffs
The introduction of the income tax not only brought political agreements (in the form of political participation within an oligarchic republic structure), but also inter-sectoral economic compromises. The most important one was the introduction of higher/newer tariffs designed to protect the industrial sector. Protectionism boosted industrial production and enhanced other structural transformations, such as the rising of the middle class and higher levels of urbanization. A common misconception is that industrial protectionism started with the ISI. ``The fact that manufacturing was alive and thriving in Latin America before the 1929 crash is now beyond question''\footnote{\citet[p. 129]{Bertola2012}.}. ISI in fact is a continuation of older policies. \citet[p. 3-4]{Haber2005} explains that ``governments followed policies designed to subsidize and protect industry in the decades after 1950 precisely because industrialists and industrial workers had been protected since the 1890s''. Building on this research agenda, we claim that early industrialists were able to bargain tariffs in exchange for income taxation. This insight goes in line with \citet[p. 53]{Lederman2005} who argues that the timing of protectionist and income taxation cycles match. In fact, the industrialists \emph{as a sector}, gathered around this issue in quite an organized way, reinforcing their class self-image. As \citet[p. 122]{Sokoloff2007a} argue, the expansion of the ``manufacturing production [...] helped to nurture the development of a powerful constituency for higher tariffs''. The introduction of higher/newer tariffs was key for the subsequent development of the industrial sector. As \citet[p. 15]{Haber2005} argues, ``virtually none of [the industrial development] would have existed had it not been for tariff protection''\footnote{See also \citet[p. 21]{Coatsworth2002}. There is some debate on whether protectionism is associated to economic growth, however. \citet[p. 10]{Coatsworth2002} argue that ``protection was associated with faster growth in the European core and their English-speaking offshoots [...] but it was \emph{not} associated with fast growth in [...] Latin American periphery'' (emphasis in the original).}.



% several institutions: property right protection, growth,
These transformations triggered a sequence of other institutional investments. Now that both sectors had access to political and military resources, the two elites were interested in protecting each other's property from mutual expropriation. Property rights protection has been associated to economic growth. For example, \citet[p. 35]{Grossman1994} argue that secured property rights shifts the incentives to invest in ``[i]nnovation [which in turns] sustains both capital accumulation and growth''\footnote{This model has been so called ``protection for sale model''.}. Economic growth expanded the tax base too. That is why taxation has also been associated to property rights protection. \citet[p. 531]{Timmons2005} explains that ``[t]he more money a state raises from progressive taxes as a percentage of GDP [...] the better it protects property rights''\footnote{See also \citet[p. 6]{Roclrik2000} for a general overview.}. Alternative models developed to understand the European case suggest that the bourgeoisie seeks protection against the expropriative policies of the king. However, we claim that in Latin America \emph{institutions protected the elite from themselves}. Higher levels of economic growth have also been associated to accumulation of human capital. \citet[p. 842]{Brown2004} find that ``[Latin American] democracies devote a higher percentage of their educational resources to primary education''. In turn, human capital accumulation sat down the foundations for the emergence of the middle class composed by ``urban professionals, state employees in the private sector, artisans and craftsmen''\footnote{\citet[p. 185]{Rueschemeyer:1992}.}. As \citet[p. 394]{Collier:2002db} suggest, ``the middle classes did well under [the competitive oligarchies regimes]. The size of the middle class expanded significantly not only as a result of economic growth in general,  but also as a result of growing public employment as the state expanded''\footnote{\citet[p. 12]{Geddes:1996fr} explains that government officials are self-interested individuals, and hence ``their responses differ''. However, we assume that the political interests of bureaucrats, presidents and congresses, are in line with their respective sectoral interests. Thus, we consider that ``the state''is itself an actor.}. These economic structural transformations were deeply linked to the seeds of early democratic development. As \citet[p. 7]{Rueschemeyer:1992} argue, ``capitalist development is associated with democracy because it transforms the class structure''. This paper focuses on one of these class transformations, particularly \emph{within} the elites, namely, the emergence (or not) of an industrial class and the decline (or not) of the agricultural/traditional sector. 


\section{Unpacking the Mechanisms: Illustrative Case, Chile 1850-1930\label{unpacking}}

In this section, we illustrate our theory by bringing the Chilean case to the analyses.


% Who where the agriculturalists 
From an economic standpoint, before and during the colonial period, agriculture was the most important sector. Besides supplying European markets with raw materials, Latin American economies supplied ``a variety of tropical foods and [other] goods [such as] sugar, coffee, and tobacco [...] The demand for such items was stimulated by the rising consumption of the new and prosperous European bourgeoisie''\footnote{\citet[p. 74]{Marichal:1989bh}.}. 

% Agriculturalists were the monopolists
Politically, agriculturalists monopolized the political realm. \citet[p. 106]{Collier:2002db} argue that the \begin{displayquote}``national government was dominated by the central part of the country, with owners of large agricultural holdings playing a predominant role within a framework in which this cohesive elite increasingly absorbed the elites of the urban commercial and incipient manufacturing sector''. \end{displayquote}The historiography has contradictory references, however. Some say that they were obvious antagonists. Some have argued, for example, that the landed elite conformed very strong economic and political monopolies\footnote{\citet[p. 15]{McBride:1971fv} argues that ``Chile's people live on the soil. Her life is agricultural to the core. \emph{Her government has always been of farm owners. Her Congress is made up chiefly of rich landlords}. Social life is dominated by families whose proudest possession is the ancestral estate''. Emphases are mine.}. Others have claimed that this antagonism is wrong\footnote{	See for example  \citet[p. 125]{Mamalakis:1976kx}.}. The main argument against this vision is that there was a very blurry division between these ``two'' classes\footnote{\citet[p. 30, 44, 94, 108]{Bauer:2008kx}.}. For example, landowners were also invested in industry\footnote{\citet[p. 23]{Coatsworth2002} argue that ``[t]he only landowners that mattered in 19th century Latin America politics were those for whom land represented but one asset in a much broader portfolio''. In the same line, \citet[180]{Bauer:2008kx} argues that  ``[m]iners and merchants bought haciendas but landowners in turn invested in banks, insurance companies, commercial firms and the incipient industrial sector''.}. However, there are some stylized facts that strongly suggest that \emph{in general}, agricultural elites were \emph{primus inter pares}. %To understand how concentrated the economy was, it is helpful to see the structure of loans and the stock market. Around 1865, Chilean landowners held 49\% of the shares of the joint-stock enterprises while Chilean merchants (which mostly exported agricultural goods) held only  16\% percent\footnote{\citet[p. 83]{Marichal:1989bh}. Foreign traders held the remaining 35 percent.}.
First, historiographic evidence suggests that the agricultural sector did  monopolize politics. \citet[p. 13]{Zeitlin:1984aa} argues that ``landowners controlled both the vote and the labor power of the agrarian tenants (\emph{inquilinos}) and dependent peasants (\emph{minifundistas}), and this was the \emph{sine qua non} of their continuing political hegemony''. In Congress, and the presidency itself, landowners were the single most important group\footnote{\citet[p. 45]{Bauer:2008kx}.}, leaving the modern sector heavily under-represented. As \citet[p. 1748]{Baland2008} argue, ``[c]ongressional representation was heavily weighted in favor of rural districts where the peasantry historically formed a pliable and controllable mass base for conservative and reactionary groups''. Second, and as a consequence, fiscal pressures in favor of agricultural taxes were minimal as opposed to mining taxes (as we explain below, one of the first manifestations of industrial activity). As \citet[p. 56]{Best1976} explains, ``when all central government taxes are considered, agriculture is still substantially undertaxed relative to the other sectors''\footnote{\citet[p. 81]{Bauer:2008kx} provides a very plausible explanation for why the agricultural sector was ``structurally'' protected against taxation. As he explains, ``[t]he availability of an easily accountable source of public revenue - bags of nitrate or bars of cooper - meant that any need for the Chilean government to intrude into the affairs of landowners was reduced [...] the state kept its political hands off the countryside until the overwhelming urban demands for more food and political support in the 1960s''.}. The fiscal structure was heavily biased against non-agricultural interests. As explained by others, ``public revenues came almost exclusively from taxes on mining and its exports''\footnote{\citet[p. 38]{Zeitlin:1984aa}.}. Though there was an agricultural income tax, it was weak and abolished after the civil war of 1891. This bias was consistent with any type of governmental interference. Historians argue that ``[i]n those areas where the government did interfere in the countryside, the effect was to strengthen the position of the landowning class''\footnote{\citet[p. 118]{Bauer:2008kx}.}. The secretary of the treasury Benavente, right after the independence in 1823, addressed a mostly agricultural congress to propose an income tax. The congress rejected his idea specially due to pressures of the landowning class\footnote{\citet[p. 306]{Sagredo1997}. It is important to stress that during this period, ``political parties'' did not follow very clear ideological divisions. Most of the secretaries/ministries were recruited due to their technocratic skills. Skilled individuals were so scarce that some of them would resign before even starting. See \citet[p. 293-294]{Sagredo1997} for an example.}. The few public infrastructure that existed, was in favor of agriculture too. The state would either invest huge amounts of money or borrow resources to build infrastructure capable to mobilize agricultural goods, starting with the gold rush in both California and Australia\footnote{\citet[]{Rippy:1971rz,Marichal:1989bh, Zeitlin:1984aa,Bauer:2008kx}.}. For instance, in Chile, a foreign investor ``was contracted to build a second state-sponsored railroad that would connect Santiago with the south-central agricultural districts''\footnote{\citet[p. 85]{Rippy:1971rz}.}. This was not an isolated issue, but a clear  pattern. Presidents also engaged in the same deliberated practices. For example, ``the Montt regime did invest in the construction of Chile's railways but only in the Central Valley and south-central zones [b]ut there was no public investment [...] in railroads built in the Norte Chico mining provinces, which in fact provided most of the state's tax revenues''\footnote{\citet[p. 41]{Zeitlin:1984aa}.}. 

% The Industrial sector and its origins: mining 
The origins of the the industrial sector are much older than the ISI policies of the 1950s. ``The development of large-scale, mechanized (and even ``heavy'') industry can be dated from the 1890s in the region's larger economies''\footnote{\citet[p. 2]{Haber2005}.}. For almost 400 years, mining was the most important activity not related to agriculture. ``Minerals had to be processed near the areas where they were mined in order to keep transport costs to a minimum. This led to the construction of foundries and, at times, refineries, which became the cornerstones for the early stages of the industrialization of the mining-based economies''\footnote{\citet[p. 129]{Bertola2012}.}. Although it was very important during the colonial period, not only ``Latin American's consumption of industrial metals continued to be very small until toward the end of the nineteenth century'', but also it was very rudimentary showing little or no technological refinement\footnote{\citet[p. 230]{Rippy:1971rz}.}. Most mineral-related industry (if not all) was foreign owned, except for Chile\footnote{\citet[p. 165, 176, footnote 5, 324]{Rueschemeyer:1992}.}. Mining elites made their fortunes during the 1840s-1850s during the mining boom. After the boom, the mining elite shifted to the first ``true'' industrial work which actually was  born under agricultural auspices, i.e. the cotton mills\footnote{See \citet[p. 231]{Rippy:1971rz} and \citet[p. 271]{Bethell2008}. As \citet[p. 271]{Bethell2008} argues, ``[t]he first power looms were brought [in Per\'u, Ecuador, and Venezuela] in the 1840s, 1850s; but in all three they were a failure, some of the early mills in Ecuador being destroyed by an earthquake. It was not until after 1890 that textile industries of these nations began to operate with reasonable success. Guatemala's first cotton mill was established in 1882, and between that date and 1910 a few mills appeared in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Colombia'' (\citet[p. 232]{Rippy:1971rz}).}. 

% The Industrial sector and its origins: obrajes
The first ``industries'' were called  \emph{obrajes}\footnote{I.e., Proto-industrial redoubts.}. Though servile and slave labor were used at the end of the colonial period, all labor was free and waged starting in the independence period. ``Large-scale \emph{obrajes} existed alongside smaller units of production - modest workshops and prosperous artisan-dominated enterprises -  in virtually all urban centres''\footnote{\citet[p. 271]{Bethell2008}. Emphasis in original.}. Beyond cotton and the textile industries, early industrialists also processed other agricultural goods\footnote{For instance, they processed animal grease and tallow (for soap and candles), dried and cured meats, flour, bread, beer, wines, spirits - most of these were for domestic consumption (\citet[p. 272]{Bethell2008}). Other food industries, such as sugar (\citet[p. 129]{Bertola2012}) to be used in the production of chocolate, candies, biscuits.  Vegetable oils were also very important.}. Other industries for domestic consumption too developed around 1900\footnote{Some examples are tobacco, pottery, felt hats, matches, footwear, specially in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Per\'u (\citet[p. 235]{Rippy:1971rz}).}. The industrial sector was boosted by the international scenario too. For example, ``[m]eat exports required the development of cold-storage technologies''\footnote{\citet[p. 129]{Bertola2012}.}. From an international trade perspective, \citet[p. 5]{Haber2005} argues that given a change in the  metallic standard, ``exchange rate depreciation resulted in the expansion of the tradables sectors at the expense of non-tradables''. Lower transportation costs and higher demand for processed grains in Europe also played a big role boosting early  industrial production. As \citet[p. 68]{Bauer:2008kx} argues, ``[b]ad harvests in Europe and disruptions caused by wars were other factors that enabled Chilean grain to be sold on European Markets''. 

% The Industrial sector and its origins: started very small // class (0)
Industrial work started very small\footnote{\citet[p. 68]{Marichal:1989bh}.}, progressing ``from the shop to the factory during the latter half of the nineteenth century''\footnote{\citet[p. 235]{Rippy:1971rz}.}. In Chile, almost all non-agricultural produce were personified by an incipient, yet strong group of individuals. As historian Francisco Encina described it, \begin{displayquote}``[i]t was precisely this segment of the dominant class that consummately personified the development of Chilean capitalism (mineowner and banker, railroad magnate and manufacturer, shipper and trader, \emph{hacendado} and miller were most frequently not only close associates, or drawn from the same family, but they were same individuals: Ossa, Edwards, Vicu\~{n}a Mackenna, Matta, Goyenechea, Cousi\~{n}o, Urmeneta, Gallo, Subercasaux)''\footnote{In \citet[p. 30]{Zeitlin:1984aa}. Emphasis in the original.}.\end{displayquote}

% The Industrial sector and its origins: started very small // class (1)
From the process of going from mineowners to proto-industrialists, this incipient elite developed a strong sense of social \emph{class} which consistently sought political representation and influence. \citet[p. 109]{Collier:2002db} explain that the \emph{Alianza Liberal} was \begin{displayquote}``the political expression of the new groups that began to emerge in the late 19th century with the expansion of the commerce and industry and the opening of the new mining areas [...] As these groups gained social and economic importance, they began to emerge as a political force''.\end{displayquote} Additionally, during the 1920s industrialists started to ``form trade associations to engage in lobbying and propaganda as more coherent interest groups''\footnote{\citet[p. 107]{Weaver:1980vn}.}, such as the \emph{Sociedad de Fomento Fabril} (SOFOFA) founded in 1883 to represent the interests of the the industrial sector against the interests of the agricultural sector, represented by the \emph{Sociedad Nacional de Agricultura} (SNA), founded in 1838.

% Inter-class inequality and inter-class conflicts // Political bargains
The structural transformation of the industrialization of the economy brought an unstable combination that was not sustainable: a situation of \emph{inter-elite economic equality paired with inter-elite political inequality} was not an equilibrium. Agricultural elites did not have a political counterpart and hence engaged in several predatory practices. Additionally, the fiscal deficit originated in the deceleration of trade taxes put domestic fiscal pressures for rulers to draw on industrial output too. Agricultural exports in Chile, such as wheat production, had a boom between 1865-1875 until 1880\footnote{\citet[p. 68-69-70]{Bauer:2008kx}. See also \citet[p. 55]{Lederman2005}. Declining custom duties also happened in several other countries of Latin America. See \citet[p. 245]{Bulmer-Thomas2003}.}. However, ``[t]he importance of trade taxes as sources of public revenues began a steady decline in 1918, which lasted until 1925. This downfall is explained by the fall of export revenues caused by the collapse in the prices of Chile's major exports during the war''\footnote{\citet[p. 54-55]{Lederman2005}.}. For these two reasons (fiscal pressures and lack of political counterpart), governments before the 1920s held several confiscatory policies. As some historians have argued, incumbents engaged in ``nationalization by means of naturalization, government intervention, and government participation''\footnote{\citet[p. 238]{Rippy:1971rz}.}. Chile, Per\'u, Uruguay, among others, went through a clear processes of nationalization of non-agricultural assets around the 1920s\footnote{\citet{Chua2010}.}. In Chile, for example, these two sectors had enough antagonistic preferences that they confronted each other in two bloody civil wars. \citet[p. 23]{Zeitlin:1984aa} argues that the civil wars challenged a ``large landed property [elite against a] productive capital [elite]''. As \autoref{fig:incometax} suggests, Chilean industrial output had relatively similar levels when compared to the agricultural sector, however. We argue that this situation of sustained industrial growth forced agricultural elites to redefine their strategies, and rather than confront the industrial sector, encourage it. Industrial output was large enough to compensate the costs of having access to economic resources in the future. In 1924 then the income tax law was passed. As others have observed, ``[t]here was visible bargaining: [the non-agricultural sector] (reluctantly) accepted taxation, \emph{while demanding state services and expecting to influence how tax revenues were spent}''\footnote{Carmenza Gallo, in \citet[p. 165]{Brautigam2008}. Emphases are mine. She refers specifically to nitrate producers.}. The industrial sector heavily campaigned for policies favorable to them, particularly, economic protection. For example, the SOFOFA pursued an agenda in favor of protective industrial tariffs\footnote{\citet[p. 54]{Lederman2005} and \citet[p. 18]{Haber2005}.}. Consistent with the economic literature on lobby\footnote{\citet{Grossman1994a}.}, ``protection pattern[s] [differ] between politically organized and non-organized sectors''\footnote{\citet[p. 1136]{Goldberg1999}.}. The SOFOFA was able to set the agenda regarding tariffs. In particular, ``by the early 1920s Chile's manufacturers were no longer just demanding (and obtaining) protective tariffs, they actively lobbied for government subsidies to establish a range of new industries''\footnote{\citet[p. 18]{Haber2005}.}. Moreover, the Aguirre Cerda government in 1939 created the CORFO an agency that ``undertook the responsibility for economic planning and direction by identifying certain industrial sectors to support through various sorts of credits, subsidies [and] government investments''\footnote{\citet[p. 393]{Collier:2002db}.}. 



% political concessions had the expected outcomes on the formation of fiscal capacities
Economic and political concessions had the expected outcomes on the formation of fiscal capacities, and ultimately, on state capacities. Going from skilled bureaucracies able to monitor personal incomes to oligarchic congresses were needed. Oligarchic competition allowed keeping each elite accountable. This insight is consistent with \citet[p. 36]{Kurtz:2013aa} who explains how the ``incorporation of upper-class actors from all major factions into the national political system - while maintaining the exclusion of the popular sectors - [was] crucial to enabling cooperation in state building and public goods provision activities''\footnote{This alliance between elites was key to centralize power and to ``impos[e] substantial taxation'' (\citet[p. 37]{Kurtz:2013aa}).}. New fiscal resources were targeted to improve key functions of the state, such as public administration and the army. As other have observed, the early Chilean government ``was able to impose a substantial tax [...] and pay the salaries of government and military employees''\footnote{\citet[p. 80]{Bauer:2008kx}. He refers particularly to ``nitrate exports'', another non-agricultural source of growth.
}. Eventually, as the relative size of the industrial sector increased, industrial elites were able to gain ground in politics, managing to impose other important institutions such as the secret ballot. This institutional modification came to correct a long-standing situation that had had precluded industrialists compete on equal terms with the agricultural incumbents. As \citet[p. 1749]{Baland2008} argue, ``[t]he introduction of the secret ballot had an immediate impact on the balance of political power in Chile [as] landowners could no longer effectively control the votes of rural labor''. 

\section{Econometric Analyses\label{methods}}

In this section we test that inter-elite economic equality posited challenges to agricultural political incumbents. Following \citet{Aidt2009a}, we model the conditional hazard ratio that a country which has not yet adopted the income tax adopts it in a given year as a function of the relative sizes of the agricultural and industrial sectors. We compute these hazard ratios using several functional forms. First, we assume a Cox proportional hazard parametrization to compute the hazard rate of a country at a given year to ``fail'' (i.e., implement the income tax law) conditional on baseline covariates\footnote{\citet{Box-Steffensmeier2004}.}. Countries drop out of the sample when they adopt the income tax. Additionally, we employ other functional forms too. We also assumed a generalized estimating equation (GEE) functional form  which are usually used to analyze longitudinal and other correlated data especially when they are binary\footnote{\citet{Hanley2003}.}. This model estimates the conditional likelihood of implementing the income tax conditional on a set of covariates. We also assumed a conditional logit form (``fixed effects'' model) to control for country-specific effects. In order to correct time dependency, we included different time-transformed variables, in the form of a lagged dependent variable to account for partial adjustment of behavior over time\footnote{\citet{Wawro2002}.} and time-transformed functions. Panel-corrected standard errors\footnote{I.e., ``robust variance''.} were also included. Additionally, in order to test that income taxation initiated a \emph{path} of institutional investments, particularly the incorporation of an oligarchic system, we incorporated a generalization of the Cox models, and estimated an Andersen-Gill model\footnote{\citet[185-]{Therneau2000}.}. Using a slightly different data structure, we estimated the \emph{jointly} occurrence of income taxation \emph{and} democracy, within a multiple failure-time framework\footnote{This data structure is different in the sense that countries drop out of the sample once \emph{both} income taxation \emph{and} democracy occur.}. All these models strongly suggest that faster industrial outputs are strongly correlated to the imposition of the income tax law, but also to the \emph{jointly} realization of the income tax and democracy.

\subsection{Data and Sample\label{data}}

We estimate all models using the \href{http://moxlad-staging.herokuapp.com/home/en?}{MOxLAD} dataset\footnote{``These data build on the studies and statistical abstracts of the Economic Commission for Latin America, but also rely on Mitchell's International Historical Statistics, International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics, the World Bank's World Development Indicators and a variety of national sources''.}. This dataset provides extended comparable sectoral value-added series in constant purchasing power parity prices\footnote{See \citet[p. 790]{Astorga2005}.}. Our sample is given by all Pacific coast countries for which we have available data, that is, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Per\'u, Colombia and Guatemala (see \autoref{fig:incometax}). The time span goes from 1900 to (potentially) 2010. Observations are left-censored before the timespan, and right-censored after the timespan. However, as stated before, countries dropout of the sample once they impose the tax income for the Cox models, and when \emph{both} democracy and the income tax happen (for the Andersen-Gill model). The timing of democracy and the imposition of the income tax laws are depicted in \autoref{fig:incometax}.

% comments on the Results Table
\autoref{results:1} shows six models\footnote{All tables were produced using the  \texttt{texreg} package (\citet[]{Leifeld:2013qy}). All Cox models were computed using the \texttt{survival R}  package (\citet{Therneau:2015zr}). The  GEE logistic regression was computed using the \texttt{geepack} package (\citet[]{Hojsgaard:2016}). This paper was written in \LaTeX \; using the dynamic report \texttt{R} package \texttt{knitr} (\citet[]{Xie:2016hl}), for fully replicable research.}. The first three are Cox models, under different time-transformations. The fourth model is a conditional logistic regression (``fixed effects'' model). The fifth model is an Andersen-Gill model which predicts the jointly realization of both the income tax and democratization. Finally, the sixth model shows a GEE logistic regression model. All these results strongly suggest that higher levels of industrial output are associated to the imposition of the income tax\footnote{``Because the coefficients are parameterized in terms of the hazard rate, a positive coefficient indicates that the hazard is increasing as a function of the covariate (and hence, the survival time is decreasing) and a negative sign indicates the hazard is decreasing as a function of the covariate'' (\citet[p. 50]{Box-Steffensmeier2004}).}. In substantive terms, as the size of the industrial sector catches up with the size of the agricultural incumbents, the political monopoly of the latter is broken, giving way to a series of political and economic bargains. Here we have theorized (and demonstrated in our \hyperref[unpacking]{historical} case study) that in exchange for the income tax, industrial tariffs were implemented along with more secure conditions for industrial newcomers to participate in politics. The Andersen-Gill model strongly suggests that this is the case. Some times, we control for different measures of population density. Population has been associated to the probability in which elites expanded the franchise. Denser populations also expand the tax base. The scarcity of people meant that local and state governments were extremely concerned with attracting migrants. Because population inflows would lower the cost of labor, and boost land values and tax revenues, these societies were induced to adopt institutions attractive to immigrants. Among these, were cheap land and political participation\footnote{\citet[p. 892-893]{Engerman2005}.}.

% comments on the simulation
Following \citet{Gandrud2015} and \citet{King2000}, \autoref{fig:simulation:1} and \autoref{fig:simulation:2} show 2,000 simulations from a variant of the main model (model 2 in \autoref{results:1})\footnote{It is important to stress that \emph{both} sectors are included in the model, and hence, one sector acts as the control variable of the other sector.} and show their individual simulated predictions in two separate plots\footnote{The \texttt{simPH} package does not handle natural logs well. Hence, we estimated an alternative model that considers the same sample and specification than the main model (model 2), but without taking the natural log on the variables considered. In the appendix section, \autoref{results:2} shows the results. The numbers differ from the main results in \autoref{results:1} because the scales are different.}. These plots strongly suggest that higher industrial output substantively boosted the introduction of the income tax, while higher agricultural output systematically diminished the risk of the introduction of the income tax. Altogether these results strongly argue in favor of the theory presented here, namely, income taxation was possible once the status quo which was favorable to the agricultural sector, was  broken in order to give way to a path of institutional investments.

\subsection{Robustness Checks}

Cox \emph{proportional} models rest on the assumption that hazard rates are \emph{proportional} to time dynamics\footnote{\citet{Box-Steffensmeier2004}.}. Non-proportional hazard model are becoming an increasing problem across all subfields in political science\footnote{\citet{Licht2011}.}. In this section, we test whether this assumption holds. Non-significant p-values indicate that the proportionality assumption holds. Also, \autoref{fig:coxassump} shows how the spline fitted lines are constant across time. Each of the seven dots represent the regression coefficients of our seven countries\footnote{This is for our main model, column 2 in \autoref{results:1}.}. All in all, steady splines confirm that the hazard rates are, in fact, \emph{proportional}.

\section{Discussion\label{discussion}}

This paper built not only on the fiscal sociology approach but also on the sectoral politics paradigm. States capacities, we argued, are part of a larger ``package'', where both economic and political structural transformations take part also. The development of a strong industrial sector output not only generated domestic incentives for the imposition of an income tax. It also broke old paradigms of semi-servile labor. Though the post-colonial agricultural sector used waged labor, it took several decades of state penetration to completely eliminate all traces of semi-servile labor. In many agricultural redoubts, still today, we can see servile and semi-servile traditions and customs. From the get-go, industrial work, had none of that. In part, urbanization and the separation of place of work and place of residence (specially for the working class), prevented the industrial sector to adopt non-modern practices. \citet[]{Kurtz2006,Kurtz2009,Kurtz:2013aa}\footnote{He argues that labor-repressive agrarian economies leave local elites extremely vulnerable to the centralization of authority. And such, agrarian elites will resist the taxation necessary to support military modernization or even collective defense (\citet{Kurtz2006}.).} explains how labor-repressive agrarian economy is negatively associated to state capacities. Expanding on that idea, we argued that states that were able to make political and economic concessions could secure via institutional investments the foundations of the modern state. It was a necessary condition to abandon any type of repressive labor, and that was possible due to the development of a strong industrial sector.

\subsection{Additional Graphical Representations}

\autoref{fig:simpleplots} shows two simple plots of the conditional hazard rates. These two pieces of information strongly suggest, conditional on both covariates, industrial output increases the risk of imposing an income tax law.

 Bob: 
 
  - I'd also like to see a bit more flesh on the bones when you talk about fiscal capacity -- perhaps in the Chilean case, if not more generally.  Presumably, you mean not only an income tax, but also an expansion of the bureaucracy that is supposed to monitor and collect it.    
  - Did they reform the Finance Ministry, for example, or add to the tax agency budget? 


 Me: 

  - Put more meat/meaning to the Cox prediction/simulation plot. For ex., how much longer does it take for a country with ``low'' industrial development? Make sure I put concrete numbers in the Discussion section. CALCULATE THE FISCAL DEVELOOPMENT DELAY
  - INCLUDE : Galindo-Silva2014
  - Include DISTANCE measurement instead of separate covariates per each sector.
  - (from Steave Levitsky's talk) Lack of state capacities UNDERMINES democracy: Channels are that democracy (1) reduce inequality, reduce gov't performance (NOT NECCESARILY I THINK), less programmatic parties.
  - SUBNATIONAL: (from Raul Madrid and Juan Pablo's talk): idea that there are ``parallel universes''/``out-of-sync'' clusters of underdevelopment. MExico has more state capacities than before, but more disappearances too. MADRID: State capacities for WHOM. Also, DEMOCRACY is NECC but NOF SUFF for STATE CAPACITIES.
  - From Jose Pablo Silva: (1) the state was competing for the “monopoly” of the capable/educated people (i.e. bureaucrats). I’ve read somewhere that the early Chilean state had a really hard time finding capable people, usually from the business sector, to be part of the gabinetes presidenciales. They would usually resign before accept the position. (2)  guys that were checking whether bureaucrats were actually working might work as a proxy for the impact of income tax on the formation of state, particularly, on the reformation of bureaucracies. (3) ``Intimate Ironies: Modernity and the Making of Middle-Class Lives in Brazil'' book, check for the case where Chilean/Brazilian bureaucrats checked other bureaucrats.

Matthias vom Hau:

  - My paper is ``against'' factor endowments.
  - where does industrialization come from: is it endogenous to prior state capacities? 
  - Check on Andreas Wimmer: he controls for ``prior'' state capacities. DOI: 10.1177/0010414015592645
  - What's the distinction between POLITICAL and ECONOMIC power?: Be more explicit regarding this. 
  - Engage with this literature that says that POWERFUL ELITES cause STATE CAPACITIES.
  - 


% Hence we focus our theory of the origins of fiscal capacities after the colonial period\footnote{\citet[p. 43]{Kurtz:2013aa} considers this period of time the ``first critical juncture''.}.

% These \emph{indirect} sources of revenue do not lead to the development of strong fiscal capacities since the state needs little organizational and political effort to collect those taxes. \emph{Direct} taxation, however, does generate domestic incentives to make institutional investments, such as professional bureaucracies. %Without a strong bureaucracy able to collect and administer tax money is very difficult to conceive any theory of the state. That is why taxation and bureaucratization are correlated. Since direct taxation was product of an inter-elite political bargain, it also played a formative role in that it seeded the basis for a competitive oligarchic political system. 

% faced higher costs of imposing an income tax system and opening up the political system to other economic elites. Low 

% rapid and sustained industrial growth constituted more of a ``secure promise'' of growth for the future. 

%Definition of democracy: \citet[p. 27]{Lipset:1981uq}: ``Democracy in a complex society may be defined as a political system which supplies regular constitutional opportunities for changing the governing officials, and a social mechanism which permits the largest possible part of the population to influence major decisions by choosing among contenders for political office''.



%- INCLUDE Przeworski1997: “Modernization consists of a gradual differentiation and specialization of social structures that culminates in a separation of political structures from other structures and make democracy pos- sible”

%- O’Donnell [1973] critics that “bureaucratic-authoritarian governments”8 appear when the country experiences economic devel- opment.


%- According to modernization theory, there is a threshold (per capita income of 6k, Przeworski and Limongi [1997, 159]). Lipset [1959, 75] proposed the already classic hypothesis that high levels of economic development are associated to stable democracies (“the more well-to-do a nation, the great the chances that it will sustain democracy”). Basically, the mechanism is that higher levels of industrialization, will cause more levels of urbanization, education, which in turns lead to higher levels of democracy. In reverse, Lipset [1994, 1] argues that “new democracies have low levels of legitimacy [in consequence,] [t]o attain legitimacy, what new democracies need above all is efficacy, particularly in the economic arena, but also in the polity. If they can take the high road to economic development, they can keep their political houses in order”.

%- Boix et al. [2012, 1545] find that “a standard set of economic modernization variables sharply declined in their predictive accuracy since the early 20th century, falling to the point that fixed geographic variables are now better predictors of democracy”.

%- Przeworski and Limongi [1997, 177] Supports agency theory, like in O’Donnell and Schmitter [1986], “The emergence of democracy is not a by- product of economic development. Democracy is or is not established by political actors pursuing their goals, and it can be initiated at any level of development. Only once it is established do economic constrains play a role: the chances for the survival of democracy are greater when the country is richer”. 

%- Przeworski et al. [2000, 137] argues that “wealthy countries tend to be democratic not because democracies emerge as a consequence of economic development under dictatorships but because, however they emerge, democracies are much more likely to survive in affluent societies [in consequence, there is no] thresholds of development that would make the emergence of democracy predictable”

%- VER PAGINA 55 DE ODONELL 1973

%- \citet[p. 33]{Lipset:1981uq}: ``the average wealth, degree of industrialization and urbanization, and level of education is much higher for the more democratic countries''.

%- However Kaufman and others (see Collier [1979]) found little support for O’Donnell [1973]′s hypotheses (distilled from Mahoney and Rueschemeyer [2003]).



%Now, if the growth rate is too slow, as it is the case in the weak state cases,  discount rates simply outweigh the benefits of the little resources obtained when taxing industrialists. 

%\citet[p. 311]{Bulmer-Thomas2003}: ``The expropriation, with or without compensation, of nonland assets provided an alternative, if even more radical, route to changing the distribution of income. Although nationalizations have not been uncommon in Latin America, they have mainly affected foreign companies''

% In fact, after income taxes were imposed, ``the revenue motivation for imposing trade taxes declined''\footnote{\citet[p. 55]{Lederman2005}.}.
