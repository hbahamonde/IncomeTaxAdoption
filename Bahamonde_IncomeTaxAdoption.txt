Introduction
============

According to most political economists, fiscal sociologists, development
economist and economic historians, fiscal capacities are a prerequisite
for state-building. Unfortunately, there have not been many attempts to
explain *why* and *how* state and fiscal capacities in the developing
world emerged.[^2] With a few exceptions, most efforts have been devoted
to understanding the relationship between the politics of taxation and
state capacities only in a limited number of European cases. In a
recently edited volume, @Monson2015 [3] explain that the “New Fiscal
History has furnished a valuable set of concepts and questions but so
far its scope has been limited to post-classical Europe.”[^3] In fact,
the bulk of research on Latin America has mostly focused on *recent* tax
reforms.[^4] However, the *origins* of the Latin American *fiscal* state
remain relatively unclear. Additionally, since wars in Latin America
have been rare,[^5] it is difficult to extend models based on external
threats originally developed to understanding the medieval European
case.[^6] Importantly, domestic explanations such as the role of
sectoral conflicts within a context of economic structural
transformation, taxation and state-building has been overlooked.[^7] A
few exceptions are @Gallo:1991kx [7-8], @Beramendi2016 and
@Saylor:2014aa [8] who consider elite conflicts to study state-making
and fiscal development in the developing world.[^8] Building on the
fiscal sociology paradigm, I propose that the development of the modern
fiscal apparatus in Chile was product of sectoral conflicts and
compromises that took place around in the 1920’s between the industrial
and agricultural political elites. The paper presents several panel-data
analyses covering almost 100 years of sectoral outputs for a number of
Latin American countries in an effort to generalize the theory. Using
Cox proportional hazard regressions I model the *contribution* of each
sector on the ‘hazard’ of implementing the income tax law. I find that
the emergence of the industrial sector *accelerated* the implementation
of the income tax while the expansion of the agricultural sector
*retarded* or even *precluded* fiscal development.

![Causal
Mechanism\[causal:mechanism:fig\]](/Users/hectorbahamonde/RU/Dissertation/Papers/IncomeTaxAdoption/causal_path.pdf)

I argue that the early implementation of the income tax in Latin America
was product of an inter-sectoral conflict that took place around in the
early 1900’s between the agricultural and industrial sectors. Initially,
Latin American political institutions and social norms largely inherited
from the colonial period were designed to serve the interests of the
landowning elites. However, the economic structural transformation
characterized by “a secular decline of agriculture and substantial
expansion of manufacturing”[^9] imposed tight constraints on the way
politics was run by the incumbent agricultural class. Given the initial
advantage of the landed elites, the emergence of the industrial sector
meant the reduction of inter-sectoral inequality. Lower levels of
inter-sectoral inequality posed credible political, economic and
military threats to agricultural incumbents, increasing the opportunity
costs of conflict, generating pressures for inter-elite compromises.
Analytically, the emergence of the industrial sector not only altered
the structure of the economy but also the inter-sectoral balance of
*political* power, triggering a series of inter-sectoral compromises.
Here I identify one such compromise, the implementation of the income
tax law.

In this paper I leverage a number of Cox regressions using comparative
data on a number of Latin American countries to suggest that a rapid
expanding industrial sector accelerated the implementation of the income
tax. To explore the causal mechanisms at work more deeply, I present the
Chilean case to show that industrial elites accepted to be income taxed
by agriculturalist incumbents in exchange of having a more open
political system and more state services. I explain that when the income
tax was implemented under politically contested circumstances (as it
happened in Chile), this institution expanded the overall state
capacities by crystallizing a series of reforms that replaced the old
institutional order inherited since colonial times. However, when the
income tax was imposed late in history, its implementation did not
reflect the *early foundational sectoral cleavage*, an important feature
according to the fiscal sociology, truncating the development of state
institutions. For example, Chile imposed the income tax law in 1924, and
the *Servicio de Impuestos Internos* is among the finest tax
institutions in Latin America. However, Guatemala imposed the income tax
law very late, in 1963, and by 1967 the national income tax office
employed 194 people, and only 9 of whom had graduated from college.[^10]
While Guatemala implemented the tax, the institution did not reflect the
preferences of both sectors. In fact, the law responded more to
exogenous forces. Particularly, the law was implemented by the US-backed
dictator Colonel Enrique Peralta Azurdia, not necessarily reflecting the
inter-sectoral domestic dynamics. In these kinds of scenarios,
landowners were never challenged and there were less pressures to
centralize the state, making further institutional investments less
likely. These results go in line with @Beramendi2016 [7] in that ‘so
long as agricultural elites are the dominant political power-holders in
society, then fiscal capacity should remain relatively small, because
such elites will prefer *not* to invest in greater fiscal
capacity.’[^11] Consequently, the tax was not important because of the
new revenue it collected,[^12] but because its implementation required a
series of sectoral compromises, triggering a series of other
institutional investments, such as the implementation of
checks-and-balances (to monitor tax spending) and the development of
skilled bureaucracies. Crucially, the knowledge and expertise the state
accumulated were transfered to other state institutions via spillovers,
augmenting the overall levels of *stateness*. For example, leveraging
historical earthquake data, @Bahamonde:2017ac finds that the income tax
increased the overall state capacities to reduce the death-toll of the
average earthquake in Chile.

endogenous inter-sectoral agreement. In fact, the law responded more to

average earthquake in Chile.

This argument is situated within the broader literature on political and
economic development. Particularly, the argument is situated within the
broader fiscal sociology paradigm, emphasizing how fiscal development
was important for state-making. And while some scholars situate the
relevant state-building critical juncture at the end of the colonial
period, before the class compromises I identify in this paper. For
example @Kurtz2009 [@Kurtz:2013aa] explains that the first critical
juncture corresponded to the post independence political economy,
stressing whether local rural elites recruited their workers through
servile means. In turn, @Soifer2015a [6] argues that the critical
tipping point was whether “local administrators were outsiders in the
communities in which they served.” Both critical junctures happened
*before* 1900. While the process of state-building started before 1900,
the paper identifies the income tax as an important *additional*
building block in that process.

Taxation and State Formation\[fiscal:sociology\]
================================================

According to the fiscal sociology approach, the great modern innovation
was not the rise of capitalism (Marx) nor the rise of modern bureaucracy
(Weber), but the rise of the “tax state,” which developed institutions
to penetrate individual economies.[^16] It was Schumpeter who called for
a systematic study of public finances, and to treat taxation both as
cause and consequence of large-scale changes in the structure of the
economy and the state.[^17] I use this framework to contend that the
expansion of the fiscal system embodied especially in the implementation
of the income tax was the spring of the political structural
transformation that took place around in the 1900’s. Faster industrial
output nurtured a new demanding political elite, leading to a string of
institutional investments, setting countries in a long-term path of
institutional development. I agree with @Musgrave1992 [99]: since
taxation (especially on incomes) requires such a high degree of state
penetration, public finances offer the key for a theory of state
development.

The fiscal sociology paradigm is vast.[^18] Without trying to survey all
of it, this paper follows the classical approach famously suggested by
Schumpeter in that it sees “taxation in terms of group conflicts \[and\]
class interests.”[^19] Similarly, Seligman in 1895 argued that
“\[f\]iscal conditions are always an outcome of economic
relations,”[^20] while Goldscheid in 1925 famously argued that “tax
struggles are among the oldest forms of class struggle.”[^21] This paper
is situated within this classic tradition, emphasizing the sectoral
conflicts between agricultural and industrial elites in Latin America.
As others have argued, political development and particularly “state
formation will be more likely to the degree that powerful individual
actors form two groups on the basis of *divergent* economic and
political interests.”[^22] Since state centralization affects landowners
and industrialists in different ways,[^23] this approach is especially
relevant for the Latin American case. Agriculturalists systematically
resisted taxation as land fixity increased the risk premium of their
main asset,[^24] while industrialists’ preferences toward taxation were
more elastic as capital could be reinvested in nontaxable sectors.[^25]
Taxation has always been conflictual since it has an important coercive
element. As Martin et al. argue “a tax is not a fee paid in direct
exchange for a service, but rather an obligation to contribute.”[^26]
What makes taxation relevant, conflictual and coercive is not the
tribute itself (and the potential promise of provision of public goods),
but its compulsoriness. Regardless of an individual’s race, religion,
culture or any other kind of status, the state classifies its subjects
according to their incomes and oblige them to pay, punishing whoever
refuses to do so. From a sociological standpoint, this “generality makes
taxation a crucial element in the development of the ‘imagined
community’ (@Anderson2006a) \[...\] Taxation enmeshes us in the web of
generalized reciprocity that constitutes modern society.”[^27]

Not all kinds of taxes have the same level of positive impact on
state-building. Indirect taxes do not need to develop a strong fiscal
apparatus.[^28] According to @Best1976 [53], “indirect taxes are but
substitutes for direct taxes,”[^29] and hence they are typically
administered by weak states.[^30] Since indirect taxes are, *ceteris
paribus*, easier to levy,[^31] this kind of revenue is generally
considered “unearned income”[^32] or “easy-to-collect source of
revenues.”[^33] Given the relatively lower costs states have to incur to
collect them, indirect taxes have a very low impact on state-building.
In fact, when early Latin American states depended heavily on
international trade taxes, the state apparatus tended to be less
developed.[^34] Since customs administrations in the region have always
been concentrated in a few critical locations, eespecially ports,
tariffs and customs duties did not require an elaborate fiscal
structure.[^35]

Direct taxes are more likely to produce long-lasting positive effects on
state-building. Since direct taxation involves a compulsory transfer
from private hands to the government sector for public purposes,[^36] it
is harder to collect,[^37] requiring stronger domestic alliances to
sustain these kinds of policies. Following the fiscal sociology
paradigm, in this paper I focus on the income tax. From a historical
standpoint, its introduction “was one of the major events in fiscal
history that contributed to the growth in *government* observed during
the past 150 years.”[^38] Since taxing incomes involves transforming
private income into public property,[^39] this form of taxation demands
the endogenous development of both stronger state institutions and
efficient monitoring and enforcement technologies.[^40] As others have
pointed out, “administrative constraints are identified as the main
constraint to the ability of states to collect \[the\] income tax.”[^41]
Political alliances should exist to overcome these logistic,
institutional and political domestic challenges. Critically, economic
elites, should agree to comply with the income tax.[^42] @Beramendi2016
argue that in fact Latin American “capitalist elites \[*preferred*\] to
shoulder a higher tax burden through progressive direct taxation, which
they \[viewed\] as the least-worst economic option,” fostering fiscal
expansion.[^43] Firstly, I contend that an elite divided on an
*economic* cleavage should be at the same time divided on their
*political* preferences, particularly regarding their attitude towards
state centralization.[^44] Elites split along economic interests should
then use state power to influence the institutional order in different
ways. Secondly, I contend that since tax revenues depend upon the
interests of different classes as they attempt to use state power for
their own purposes,[^45] class conflicts are more likely to resolve in
favor of direct taxation where income inequality *among the elite* is
low.[^46]

As depicted in , here I focus on how the emergence of the industrial
sector lowered the levels of inter-sectoral inequality making possible
higher levels of inter-sectoral contestation, forcing industrial and
agricultural political elites to make institutional agreements. Given
that similar degrees of sectoral economic development can be converted
into armies of similar capabilities,[^47] elites will have incentives to
make agreements rather than engaging in conflict when their
economic/military capacities are similar. For instance, in the next
section I explain how equally powerful elites managed to seek and get
support of different branches of the military. Analytically, lower
levels of inequality forced cooperation by generating credible military
threats to the incumbent elites. Furthermore, when levels of inter-elite
inequality were low (and military resources were more accessible for
both elites), war was more likely to exhaust all existent assets without
producing positive outcomes for either sector,[^48] increasing the
opportunity costs of conflict.

Unpacking the Mechanisms: Chile 1850-1950\[unpacking\]
======================================================

To provide some historical context, in this section I present the
Chilean case. As an economically and socially developed example,[^49]
this case should be able to show the inter-sectoral dynamics that
fostered institutional development. Particularly, this section shows how
the emergence of the industrial sector reduced inter-elite inequality,
generating credible threats to the agricultural landowners and promoting
sectoral agreements. I pay special attention to the conditions that led
to the implementation of the income tax law.

Historians still debate whether agriculturalists and industrialists
comprised two *different* elites. Some claim that this dualism is
incorrect.[^50] They argue that since landowners also invested in
industry,[^51] there was a blurry class division between the mining,
banking and agricultural sectors.[^52] I contend that there are a series
of facts that suggest that there was indeed a structural fracture
between the two sectors. Here I explain how there were certain practices
that mask the sectoral dualism. For example, it was common that
industrialists invested in real state. However, in many instances they
did so *just* to obtain credit. @Kirsch:1977aa [59] explains that “in a
*rural society* land offered one of the best guarantees for loans
\[since\] loans could not be secured by equipment, machinery, or
inventory. Only real estate was acceptable collateral.”[^53] In fact,
this practice shows how the credit system was oriented to give unfair
advantage to the landed elites. Similarly, @Zeitlin:1984aa [174] finds
that while there were some instances where there were mixed investments,
‘the combined ownership of capital and landed property was a distinctive
quality of *certain* of \[the elites’\] actors.’[^54] There were also
other instances where miners invested in banking. However, @Segall1953
argues that Chilean bankers, after the crisis of the mining sector
around the 1870s, acquired a number of mineral deposits given as
collateral years before, again suggesting that the lack of economic
dualism is rather apparent. Similarly, but for the Argentinean case,
@Hora2002 [609] explains that ‘the image of an entrepreneurial elite
with assets *scattered throughout several spheres of investment* does
not appear entirely correct.’[^55] And finally, @Bahamonde:2017aa
explains how the dual *structure* of the economy was *incompatible* with
a fully diversified investment portfolio. Concretely, he shows how in
some developed Latin American cases the structure of the economy was
designed to allocate resources *from* the land *to* the industries,
suggesting a situation of sectoral distinctiveness.

In all Latin American economies during and right after the colonial
period, agriculture was the most important sector.[^56] And by
extension, the economic interests of the agricultural elite were the
only economic interests represented in politics.[^57] For example,
@Collier:2002db [106] argue that initially the “national government was
dominated by the central part of the country, with owners of large
agricultural holdings playing a predominant role.”[^58] Moreover,
political institutions and social norms inherited from the colonial
period were designed to allocate economic inputs (and hence *growth*) in
a way that benefited the landowning class only.[^59]

There existed an important asymmetry. While the industrial sector was
growing, they were kept from participating in politics with the same
privileges and conditions landowners had. Consequently, it was easy for
the agricultural elite to produce policies that were designed to enhance
their sector. @Zeitlin:1984aa [13] argues that “landowners controlled
both the vote and the labor power of the agrarian tenants (*inquilinos*)
and dependent peasants (*minifundistas*), and this was the *sine qua
non* of their continuing political hegemony.” In Congress, and the
presidency itself, landowners were the single most important group,[^60]
leaving the modern sector heavily under-represented.[^61] Consequently,
fiscal pressures in favor of agricultural taxes were minimal compared
with mining taxes,[^62] leaving the agricultural sector systematically -
and substantially - undertaxed relative to other sectors.[^63]
Historians explain that “\[i\]n those areas where the government did
interfere in the countryside, the effect was to strengthen the position
of the landowning class.”[^64] For example, the little public
infrastructure that existed benefited the agricultural sector.[^65]

For nearly 400 years, mining was the most important activity outside of
agriculture. Eventually, the mining sector failed to catch up with more
efficient technologies better suited to exploit low-grade ores,[^66] and
collapsed. After the mining boom, mining elites shifted their focus to
what is considered the first *true* industrial work which began under
agricultural auspices: the cotton mills.[^67] The first industries were
called *obrajes* and beyond textiles, early industrialists processed
other agricultural goods.[^68] The industrial sector was boosted by
favorable international conditions, many times stimulating a positive
complementarity between the two sectors. Industrial activities started
very small,[^69] progressing “from the shop to the factory during the
latter half of the nineteenth century.”[^70] Importantly, modern
industrialization did *not* begin with ISI, but around 1900.
@Bertola2012 [129] find that the “fact that manufacturing was alive and
thriving in Latin America before the 1929 crash is now beyond question.”
Similarly, @Haber2005 [2] finds that the “development of large-scale,
mechanized (and even “heavy”) industry can be dated back to the
1890s.”[^71]

In Chile, the industrial elite was composed by an incipient, yet strong
and cohesive group of individuals. Historian Francisco Encina explains
that the members of the non-agricultural class were ‘not only close
associates, or drawn from the same family, but they were the same
individuals.’[^72] In the process of going from mineowners to
proto-industrialists, this incipient elite developed a strong sense of
social *class*.[^73] Sectoral interests were organized as follows. The
*Sociedad de Fomento Fabril* (SOFOFA) was founded in 1883 to represent
the interests of the the industrial sector against the interests of the
agricultural sector, represented by the *Sociedad Nacional de
Agricultura* (SNA), founded 45 years earlier. The SNA “was the most
powerful associational interest group in nineteenth-century Chile,”[^74]
and according to @Wright1975 [51], it clearly thought of itself as a
social class. By the 1920s, industrialists started to “form trade
associations to engage in lobbying and propaganda as more coherent
interest groups.”[^75]

Both economic sectors were similarly developed but only agriculturalists
had access to fair political representation. This asymmetry led these
two ‘antagonistic elites’[^76] to confront in the civil wars of
1851-1859 and 1891 between a “large landed property \[elite against a\]
productive capital \[elite\].”[^77] President Balmaceda’s overthrowing
explains the sectoral nature of these conflicts. On the one hand, he was
mainly supported by the landed elites, but later overthrown in 1891 by a
mainly industrial/mining coalition.[^78] While his agenda on
“industrial” infrastructure (mainly roads and railroads) benefited
mostly agricultural areas,[^79] his attitude towards the banking sector
(closely linked to the mining sector)[^80] was ‘all but
confiscatory.’[^81] On the other hand, however, he failed to secure a
coalition with his own sector. @Zeitlin:1984aa [127] explains that the
‘decline of wheat exports \[...\] came precisely when a vast new market
for agriculture was growing in the nitrate territory.’ As the
agricultural sector supplied the industrial areas with foodstuff, it
simultaneously increased the *sectoral dependence* of the agricultural
elites on the industrial sector, forcing the “landed proprietors \[to\]
become dependent to a considerable extent on the continuing prosperity
of the major nitrate capitalists.”[^82] He explains that while biased
investments against the industrial class played an important role, the
sectoral economic dependence between the two sectors was the major
factor that mobilized both elites into the civil war of 1891.
Ultimately, this case illustrates the sectoral economic conflicts
between the two elites. While it would be inaccurate to say that
Balmaceda was *completely* supported by agriculturalists and
*completely* opposed by industrialists, this example illustrates how
(failed) inter-sectoral alliances and biased public goods provision
against industrialists led these two groups to a military conflict in
1891. Lower levels of inter-elite inequality gave both elites access to
military resources. While *Balmacedistas* managed to secure support with
of army, *congresistas* (the anti-Balmaceda group) managed to gather
support of the navy.

The conflict left a permanent scar in the Chilean society. While the
civil war lasted only nine months, it took 10,000 lives (out of a total
population of 3 million people) and cost more than \$ 100 million,[^83]
a significant amount for a small country. This legacy materialized in an
inefficient but politically stable political system for several years.
In part, the immobilism was due to the fact that the political reforms
that gave way to a ‘parliamentary’ system came from the conflicting
elites themselves.[^84] However, the intention to avoid more violence
(at least among the elites) tended to persist. For instance, while all
“ministers, counselors of state, members of the constituent congress
\[,\] municipal officials, provincial governors and intendants, members
of the judiciary and even the lowest functionaries and ordinary
employees of Balmaceda’s government were investigated \[or\] brought to
trial,”[^85] there were a number of amnesties issued. Similarly, there
were a number of *aborted* coups in 1907, 1912, 1915 and 1919.[^86] I
identify a third additional factor. War was more likely to exhaust all
existent assets without producing positive outcomes for either sector,
putting pressures for a sectoral compromise.[^87] Three institutional
components were considered: an income tax, industrial protectionism, and
equal access to the state. Here I focus on the first component.[^88] The
faster the industrial growth, the higher the pressures to impose a tax
to capture increasing industrial incomes. This is in line with
@Besley:2011aa [59] who argue that “investing in fiscal capacity becomes
more attractive \[...\] when wages or incomes \[...\] are higher.”[^89]
@Beramendi2016 also find that investments in fiscal capacities are
conditional on the expansion of the industrial sector.

The income tax law was passed in Chile in the middle of big political
instability. In 1920 President Alessandri obtained a very close victory
against Luis Barros Borgoño,[^90] who was supported by ‘the dominant
political and landed aristocracy.’[^91] Governability was seriously
compromised as the election let the senate in control of the landowning
class, who roundly opposed tax reforms.[^92] Particularly, the
opposition had ‘serious differences \[...\] over \[Alessandri’s\]
legislative program, eespecially in connection with the proposed income
tax.’[^93] Eventually, in 1924 the income tax law was passed. As others
explain, the non-agricultural “accepted taxation, *while demanding state
services and expecting to influence how tax revenues were spent*.”[^94]
The law taxed 2% on professional income above 2,400 pesos, 3.5% on net
profits in industry and commerce above the same sum, 5% on income from
mining, and 9% per cent on incomes from real estate.[^95] Humud (1969,
p. 154) explains that the income tax generated considerable resources,
and that the tax in “1930 \[it\] would become second only to import
duties in size.”[^96] In turn, the military was concerned with the
general budget situation. Salaries of army and navy officers ‘were two
months in arrears.’[^97] Famously, on September 3 of 1924 young
officials attend the galleries of the senate and made noise with their
sabers to demonstrate their discontent. After the resignation of the
entire cabinet, president Alessandri sided with the army in an effort to
accelerate the implementation of several pieces of legislation that have
been blocked by congress for months.

The implementation of the income tax in Chile was associated with the
implementation of other state institutions, expanding the bureaucratic
*dominion* of the state. However, unlike other ‘regular’ state
institutions and services, taxing incomes in fact infiltrated the
state’s coercive sovereignty unto the individual itself. It was the
practice of this technology that gave the state the big push allowing
the reproduction of its power in other areas throughout the territory.
Following the fiscal sociology paradigm, I contend that the more
effectively the state taxed its subjects, the more knowledge accumulated
performing *other* state activities. The knowledge and expertise the
state accumulated were transfered to other state institutions via
spillovers, augmenting the overall levels of *stateness*. For instance,
it was necessary to send official emissaries to check on accounting
books of the refinery in the north, the winery in the central valley and
the *hacienda* in the south. Eventually, these delegations became more
complex, increasing the density of state presence in the territory. For
instance, @Strayer:2005uq explains how official state delegations
traveled the territory dispensing judicial decisions, fostering state
centralization. @Bahamonde:2017ac finds that the conflict over the
implementation of the income tax generated alliances with subnational
elites, fostering sustained state-capacities throughout the territory.
Also, part of its effectiveness can be explained in that (1) elites
carried a big chunk of the burden, and that (2) the most influential
economic groups agreed on the implementation of the tax.[^98] In fact,
@Bergman2003 explains that Chile is one of the few successful cases of
tax compliance in Latin America.

Econometric Analyses\[methods\]
===============================

Following the economic development typology suggested in @Mahoney:2010aa
[5], nine polities were selected. Three ‘higher level’ countries
(Argentina, Chile and Venezuela), three ‘intermediate level’ countries
(Mexico, Colombia and Perú), and three ‘lower level’ countries (Ecuador,
Nicaragua and Guatemala). I proxy sectoral conflicts and specifically
the degree in which the industrial elites challenged incumbent
landowners by using industrial and agricultural sectoral growth rates as
presented in the [MOxLAD](http://moxlad-staging.herokuapp.com/home/en?)
data.[^99] The dataset spans from 1900 to (potentially) 2010.[^100]
According to @Astorga2005 [790], these data provide extended comparable
sectoral value-added series in constant purchasing power parity
prices.[^101] Using secondary information, states *when* the income tax
was implemented, which was the specific law, and its corresponding
source(s). shows both sectoral outputs (independent variables) and the

Before estimate the models, it is important to rule out the possibility
that income taxation and sectoral development are not linked through a
spurious, time-dependent relationship. The occurrence of the outcome of
interest (taxation) should not be directly related to time itself, but
to the rise of the industrial elite. Within the framework of survival
analyses, shows the failure rate of the sample average country of
implementing the income tax if industrial development had
increased/decreased by half (‘rapid’/‘slow’).[^103] The figure strongly
suggests that the implementation of the income tax law is largely
accelerated when the size of the industrial sector increases, and that
this relationship does not depend directly on time.

shows 5 models.[^104] Following @Aidt2009a, Model 1 computes the lagged
conditional hazard ratio of a country which has not yet adopted the
income tax adopts it in a given year as a function of industrial and
agricultural outputs.[^105] Countries drop out of the sample when they
adopt the income tax. Model 2 is also a Cox regression, but with lagged
logged variables. By including time-transformed variables, in the form
of a lagged dependent variable (to account for partial adjustment of
behavior)[^106] or “the use of the natural log transformation \[to
capture\] different forms (or “shapes”) of the baseline hazard,”[^107]
Models 1 and 2 are especially well-equipped to account for possible time
dependency. Model 3 shows the estimated coefficients of a generalized
estimating equation (GEE). Generalized estimating equations were
introduced by @Liang1986 to fit clustered, repeated/correlated and panel
data.[^108] This method is especially well suited to binary data.[^109]
GEE methods require analysts to parameterize the working correlation
matrix. Though @Hedeker2006 [ 139] explain that “the GEE is robust to
misspecification of the correlation structure,”[^110] @Zorn2006 [338]
explains that whereas the choice of estimator makes little or no
difference, the unit on which the data are grouped makes a big
difference. Hence, following the advice of @Hardin2013 [166], who point
out that when “the observations are clustered (not collected over time)
\[...\] the exchangeable correlation structure” should be used, I assume
an “independence” working covariance structure, which also corrects for
small-sized panel designs.[^111] From a substantive standpoint, GEE
models provide an estimated marginal mean, or the *weighted average* of
all cluster-specific effects (or conditional means). Model 4 is a
conditional logit (or “fixed effects” model). One important advantage of
this strategy is the ability to account for country-specific effects.
For example, fiscal development could be a function of country-specific
prior state-building capacities.[^112] A number of scholars rightly
argue that post-colonial state capacities are in part a function of
pre-colonial state-capacities.[^113] Fixed-effects should be able to
account for this and other unobserved or hard-to-measure covariates,
which if left unaccounted for, would introduce omitted variable
biases.[^114] Model 5 accounts for possible spatial-temporal
dependence.[^115] Given that most of the countries I am modeling are
contiguous neighbors, it is reasonable to expect a “domino” effect.
Theoretically, being the first country in implementing the income tax
might not require the same level of domestic effort than being the last
one. Early-implementers might not have prior experience, being harder
for them to pass the law. To account for this possible spatial-temporal
dependence, a cumulative count of countries which have implemented the
law at time $t$ was included.[^116]

All in all, the models suggest that the rise of a strong industrial
sector largely accelerated the implementation of the income tax law.
Moreover, a strong agricultural sector not only has zero impact on
fiscal development, but a negative one (models 1, 3 and 4). Both pooled
results in model 3 and model 4 give the same results. I do not find that
there was spatial-temporal dependence (model 5).

Using the estimations from Model 1 in , I follow @Gandrud2015 and
@King2000, and in simulate 1000 times the Hazard Rate of implementing
the income tax law conditional on industrial and agricultural growth
rates.[^117] While the outcome of interest does *not* depend *directly*
on time,[^118] sectoral outputs do grow in time.[^119] Consequently, it
will be necessary to account for this tendency by allowing estimations
to vary with time as well.[^120] Since the Hazard Rate “is the
probability that a case will fail at time $t$,”[^121] I take advantage
of this quantity of interest which allows some dependency on both time
*and* the covariates.[^122] strongly suggest that the faster the
agricultural sector develops, the less likely the implementation of the
income tax. This relationship does *not* change at later stages of
development, suggesting that polities with a strong agricultural elite
are not associated with fiscal development. However, rapid industrial
development is associated with the acceleration of the implementation of
the income tax law. The stronger the industrial sector, the faster the
tax is implemented.

These results suggest that given the initial advantage of the landed
elites, the secular emergence of the industrial sector also meant the
reduction of inter-sectoral inequality, generating political, economic
and military threats to the landed elites, which materialized into
sectoral agreements, particularly, the implementation of the income tax
law. From a substantive point, *when* countries implement their income
taxes is an important factor for state development. Particularly,
*early* implementation of the income tax situated the conflicts and
eventual sectoral agreements about the tax during the formative national
periods. In contrast, *late* implementers adopted this state-*making*
institution due to exogenous factors that did not necessarily responded
to the sectoral economic cleavage. Finally, analyzing the sectoral
*contribution* on fiscal expansion suggested to be a fruitful exercise.
These results suggest that only industrial expansion *accelerates* the
implementation of the income tax. Critically, agricultural expansion
*delays* it.

Discussion: Slow Industrial Growth and Lack of Contestation\[discussion\]
=========================================================================

Historically, agriculturalists were a hegemonic group protected by
practices inherited from institutions originated in colonial times.
These norms survived due to institutional inertia, perpetuating their
advantaged position. However, the emergence of a strong industrial elite
altered the inter-sectoral balance of political power, making
unsustainable the political monopoly run by the landed elites. Given the
initial advantage of the landed elites, the emergence of the industrial
sector reduced the levels of inter-sectoral inequality, in turn
generating political, economic and military threats to agricultural
incumbents. Moreover, low inequality also increased the opportunity
costs of conflict, putting pressures for inter-elite compromises.

The data analyses suggested that faster industrial growth accelerated
the hazard of implementing the income tax. I interpreted the Chilean
case through the lenses of the fiscal sociology paradigm, and leveraging
historical evidence I find that industrial elites accepted to be income
taxed by agriculturalist incumbents in exchange of having a more open
political system and industrial tariffs. Importantly, all these elite
compromises took place during the formative years of the Chilean state
and during a period of structural indetermination, where no elite had a
clear economic/military/political advantage, fostering the incorporation
of all major economic elites into the national project. When the income
tax was implemented under politically contested circumstances, this
institution expanded the overall state capacities by crystallizing a
series of reforms that replaced the old institutional order inherited
since colonial times. Given the initial advantage of the landed elites,
the emergence of a strong industrial sector increased levels of sectoral
contestation. Countries with low levels of state-capacities did
eventually implement the tax. However, later implementation had to do
more with exogenous forces, leaving unaltered the backwards
institutional order inherited since colonial times.

Both the argument and the findings are situated within the broader
literature on political and economic development, particularly within
the fiscal sociology paradigm, emphasizing how fiscal development was
important for state-making. Concretely, this paradigm proportionates a
theory of state-building as it links the mechanics between the state
effort of taxing incomes and the expansion of other state services.
Future research should explore more avenues of fiscal expansion,
emphasizing domestic channels of political development, particularly
considering different types of bargaining dynamics between the
agricultural and industrial elites in the continent. To the best of my
knowledge, @Beramendi2016 and this paper are among the few of such
accounts.[^123]

    began to operate with reasonable success. Guatemala’s first cotton
