Building on the fiscal sociology and sectoral approaches, this paper outlines the conditions under which endogenous investments in fiscal institutions were most likely to occur in Chile and more generally in Latin America, starting in 1900. My analyses and case study suggest that the emergence of the industrial sector accelerated the implementation of the income tax in a number of Latin American countries. Since taxation is an important building block for state-building, these results are relevant for theories of state formation in general.
